9121,Practice,Silverstone,81,Oscar Piastri,McLaren,2023-07-08T10:49:35.352000+00:00,"So lightning towards 10.15. There you go, outside of 10.15. Copy."
9122,Qualifying,Silverstone,1,Max Verstappen,Red Bull Racing,2023-07-08T14:08:24.995000+00:00,So we're expecting again some light drizzle in around four minutes or so that could last five minutes but again not expecting it to significantly wet the tracks.
9122,Qualifying,Silverstone,1,Max Verstappen,Red Bull Racing,2023-07-08T14:11:13.474000+00:00,

9122,Qualifying,Silverstone,1,Max Verstappen,Red Bull Racing,2023-07-08T14:41:54.800000+00:00,"There are these low drops about, expected at its last around 5 minutes."

9122,Qualifying,Silverstone,1,Max Verstappen,Red Bull Racing,2023-07-08T15:18:31.338000+00:00,"You've got both McLaren's behind you. Norris was two and a half tenths behind. Gershri, three and a half tenths behind. Then it's Leclerc's science in the branding of the top five. That's good results for them. Let me make today."
9122,Qualifying,Silverstone,2,Logan Sargeant,Williams,2023-07-08T13:47:14.030000+00:00,

9122,Qualifying,Silverstone,2,Logan Sargeant,Williams,2023-07-08T14:59:12.551000+00:00,"Okay, that's track limits turn 9. I was in! I think you were not. We have to take that. Tell them to look again!"
9122,Qualifying,Silverstone,4,Lando Norris,McLaren,2023-07-08T14:05:02.154000+00:00,Do you think it's better if we do continue? So I'm up.
9122,Qualifying,Silverstone,4,Lando Norris,McLaren,2023-07-08T14:05:02.201000+00:00,We think we can do two laps but let's use this one as a cool-down lap and we can go for two laps.

9122,Qualifying,Silverstone,10,Pierre Gasly,Alpine,2023-07-08T14:41:20.520000+00:00,So ready a little bit of rain reported 15.
9122,Qualifying,Silverstone,10,Pierre Gasly,Alpine,2023-07-08T15:05:52.597000+00:00,"Yeah, it looks very similar to where I was in P3, if anything, through the session as it comes down a little bit in terms of intensity."
9122,Qualifying,Silverstone,10,Pierre Gasly,Alpine,2023-07-08T15:09:46.235000+00:00,"And you want me to be slightly closer? Sure. I'll try to hold on at the next lap. Hey, come."

9122,Qualifying,Silverstone,11,Sergio Perez,Red Bull Racing,2023-07-08T13:51:09.710000+00:00,
9122,Qualifying,Silverstone,14,Fernando Alonso,Aston Martin,2023-07-08T14:39:39.371000+00:00,"So we think light rain any minute now light rain any minute now, but it is light. Copy."
9122,Qualifying,Silverstone,14,Fernando Alonso,Aston Martin,2023-07-08T14:41:54.530000+00:00,"This is about getting a good clean first lap for now, if this rain gets bigger and a bit of rain in 15 and 16 reported."
9122,Qualifying,Silverstone,14,Fernando Alonso,Aston Martin,2023-07-08T14:45:18.908000+00:00,"and you can't consider mid-8, mid-8 from a bit of stability."
9122,Qualifying,Silverstone,14,Fernando Alonso,Aston Martin,2023-07-08T15:14:15.326000+00:00,"Yeah, good on break times, good on break times. That is a nice and warm. They're okay."

9122,Qualifying,Silverstone,16,Charles Leclerc,Ferrari,2023-07-08T14:01:41.547000+00:00,"Yes, for now we should box for dry, we box for dry. Copy understood."
9122,Qualifying,Silverstone,16,Charles Leclerc,Ferrari,2023-07-08T14:32:57.839000+00:00,"Nice carless, nice. Good to be taken last corner."
9122,Qualifying,Silverstone,16,Charles Leclerc,Ferrari,2023-07-08T14:44:43.799000+00:00,This track is clear behind and we are aiming for a single cooldown lap.
9122,Qualifying,Silverstone,16,Charles Leclerc,Ferrari,2023-07-08T14:49:12.218000+00:00,"So Charles, we believe the end of the session will be the fastest track. So we believe it's better to come in and choose the best set of tires."
9122,Qualifying,Silverstone,16,Charles Leclerc,Ferrari,2023-07-08T14:54:46.058000+00:00,What's the classic videocon? It's pushing behind. I am pushing. I am pushing. Okay. I am pushing. I am pushing. I am pushing.

9122,Qualifying,Silverstone,20,Kevin Magnussen,Haas F1 Team,2023-07-08T14:15:08.600000+00:00,and

9122,Qualifying,Silverstone,21,Nyck De Vries,AlphaTauri,2023-07-08T14:14:01.007000+00:00,and really quite a bit of X-ray
9122,Qualifying,Silverstone,23,Alexander Albon,Williams,2023-07-08T14:06:43.543000+00:00,"Okay, we think we can push next up so you can back off to this one and then push again."
9122,Qualifying,Silverstone,23,Alexander Albon,Williams,2023-07-08T14:44:09.601000+00:00,"Okay, so just single-code plus 10. Try to get in before more, right?"
9122,Qualifying,Silverstone,23,Alexander Albon,Williams,2023-07-08T15:08:39.220000+00:00,"That's a good luck on a used type. I think I've got a puncture on my front left or something. Okay, go switch to going, press is alright at the moment."
9122,Qualifying,Silverstone,23,Alexander Albon,Williams,2023-07-08T15:18:31.338000+00:00,"Sorry guys, that wasn't good. Great laps, Alex Aldo, don't be disappointed in that. Strong. Good, good qualifying session or a true clean, no track limits."

9122,Qualifying,Silverstone,24,Guanyu Zhou,Kick Sauber,2023-07-08T14:16:15.959000+00:00,"But the session will start or not? Yes it will, we have more than 3 minutes remaining."
9122,Qualifying,Silverstone,24,Guanyu Zhou,Kick Sauber,2023-07-08T14:16:16.130000+00:00,Let me know the condition with people still improving on these conditions.
9122,Qualifying,Silverstone,24,Guanyu Zhou,Kick Sauber,2023-07-08T14:29:36.075000+00:00,How are you?
9122,Qualifying,Silverstone,27,Nico Hulkenberg,Kick Sauber,2023-07-08T14:37:58.491000+00:00,"Rain is coming, rain is coming."
9122,Qualifying,Silverstone,31,Esteban Ocon,Haas F1 Team,2023-07-08T14:05:37.247000+00:00,"It's the first speed sector and the last sector, but still quite damp."
9122,Qualifying,Silverstone,31,Esteban Ocon,Haas F1 Team,2023-07-08T14:13:28.445000+00:00,"Okay, let's stay out, please. Let's stay out. Let's go for one more lap. One more lap."
9122,Qualifying,Silverstone,31,Esteban Ocon,Haas F1 Team,2023-07-08T14:14:03.491000+00:00,It's actually raining quite a lot more now. I think if we go out it's going to be wet. So that last chance is now.
9122,Qualifying,Silverstone,31,Esteban Ocon,Haas F1 Team,2023-07-08T14:19:04.332000+00:00,"Almost crashing to the alpha down, it was closed. Can't understand, we'll have a look at that."
9122,Qualifying,Silverstone,31,Esteban Ocon,Haas F1 Team,2023-07-08T14:58:06.212000+00:00,"Unfortunately we're out there. Ahhhhhhh! Yeah sorry guys, for badly managed."
9122,Qualifying,Silverstone,44,Lewis Hamilton,Ferrari,2023-07-08T14:01:07.112000+00:00,So I think this is probably going to need a hard out lap with these track conditions and we don't want to lose track position.
9122,Qualifying,Silverstone,44,Lewis Hamilton,Ferrari,2023-07-08T14:05:37.247000+00:00,"So before the lock up it was two tenths ahead of George, you got science behind two seconds."
9122,Qualifying,Silverstone,44,Lewis Hamilton,Ferrari,2023-07-08T14:10:39.514000+00:00,So it looks like light rain in the pit lane doesn't look heavy enough with that interfere.
9122,Qualifying,Silverstone,44,Lewis Hamilton,Ferrari,2023-07-08T14:26:16.952000+00:00,"I need to overtake people on track. Definitely don't lose positions, but yeah, it's probably going to be a little bit tight."
9122,Qualifying,Silverstone,44,Lewis Hamilton,Ferrari,2023-07-08T14:51:25.322000+00:00,"We're coming into New Tires and going back out again. Yes, copy. Double call. Box box."
9122,Qualifying,Silverstone,44,Lewis Hamilton,Ferrari,2023-07-08T15:18:31.338000+00:00,"Ok, so that's P7, it's just under 510th to the staff at P1. We said so."
9122,Qualifying,Silverstone,55,Carlos Sainz,Williams,2023-07-08T14:32:58.291000+00:00,"So I'll be done for what you're asking me to do there. So I could find my tar temperature, or anything, whatever. Also I am before this P3, more at risk. Copy it, sorry about that, but we want to do it."
9122,Qualifying,Silverstone,55,Carlos Sainz,Williams,2023-07-08T15:18:31.338000+00:00,"Is there any tight there? Yeah, that's tight. F*** it!"
9122,Qualifying,Silverstone,63,George Russell,Mercedes,2023-07-08T14:02:14.624000+00:00,"Yeah, copy that so we think we'll have two or three time laps of dry running."
9122,Qualifying,Silverstone,63,George Russell,Mercedes,2023-07-08T14:02:16.656000+00:00,As in before the rain comes the water paint as in before the rain comes.
9122,Qualifying,Silverstone,63,George Russell,Mercedes,2023-07-08T14:12:20.430000+00:00,"Yeah, it's raining everywhere, do you mind me?"
9122,Qualifying,Silverstone,63,George Russell,Mercedes,2023-07-08T15:18:31.338000+00:00,"All right, thanks everyone. Good work yesterday. Brace is tomorrow. We made good steps forward from FB 2. Yeah, it's up."
9122,Qualifying,Silverstone,77,Valtteri Bottas,Kick Sauber,2023-07-08T14:30:11.184000+00:00,"No power. Copy, copy. OK, don't shift, don't shift, stay in gear."
9122,Qualifying,Silverstone,81,Oscar Piastri,McLaren,2023-07-08T14:39:07.756000+00:00,Currently everything is reported as dry and I would say if anything this rain looks like it's breaking up.
9122,Qualifying,Silverstone,81,Oscar Piastri,McLaren,2023-07-08T14:43:03.487000+00:00,I believe that was so adbit now
9122,Qualifying,Silverstone,81,Oscar Piastri,McLaren,2023-07-08T15:13:41.732000+00:00,closely spaced and you so ask if there's a 10 second gap in front of you but the six cars at the end of that gap are pretty closely spaced and you will have some bunching in sector three.
9122,Qualifying,Silverstone,81,Oscar Piastri,McLaren,2023-07-08T15:18:31.338000+00:00,"Can you pull up at the boards in the back line? Copy, bend a well and I pulled up at the boards. It sounds like fun."

9126,Race,Silverstone,1,Max Verstappen,Red Bull Racing,2023-07-09T14:19:19.764000+00:00,"Okay, we're expecting some lightish rain in around two, three minutes. We'll last three or four minutes, similar to Q2."
9126,Race,Silverstone,1,Max Verstappen,Red Bull Racing,2023-07-09T14:23:50.056000+00:00,"Uh, Let's make a Article, uh, Take decided minutes. All right. All right."

9126,Race,Silverstone,1,Max Verstappen,Red Bull Racing,2023-07-09T14:52:26.873000+00:00,"In case you are struggling with front and the low speed, if 7 is available, we will leave it to you."
9126,Race,Silverstone,1,Max Verstappen,Red Bull Racing,2023-07-09T15:12:33.594000+00:00,"We're going to go ahead this time! OK, zoom our back into the"

I think that last one was a bit more difficult than I would have liked with these tyres. Overall good piece. Great jump again guys. What I mean, that's our first win here since 2012. And it matches a record of McLaren of 11 wins in a row. So yeah, mega day for the team. Well done. Yeah, great job. Great jump guys. 11 in a row. That's pretty crazy. Well done."

Yeah, I don't give a f***. I never could have been f***ed in. Just a bit of execution.

9135,Qualifying,Spa-Francorchamps,63,George Russell,Mercedes,2023-07-28T15:06:11.818000+00:00,"Yeah, a couple of that. We're just tracking a bit of a rain cell that's growing to the south of the circuits. That would be turn five onwards if it hits potentially five minutes away."
9135,Qualifying,Spa-Francorchamps,63,George Russell,Mercedes,2023-07-28T15:11:43.719000+00:00,And just make sure you look in rear brakes as well.

Okay, full vehicle out presentation. Bo 12, the W-Lawton. Pit limiter off and a static 5.5, 1st car is on the ground. Carry out, the practice starts at 30 years normal and then through the full vehicle out. Target as much, tire warming as possible. Lift the coast, it's 1013 and half the 1013, no more. It's 10% trouble. Turn the burn out from the left hand side, fire-mire-carb, post. That's just before the final painted criss-cross. To the left hand side, fire-mire-carb, post.

Now in one and a half minutes the laps cars will leave the pit lane. We'll then move you back into the pass lane once they've all left the pit lane. You will then follow the safe car out eventually.

I think I could have done a bit better on that second call to pick there, but I mean, we've got really strong pace. We should be very proud of that. There was even P6 on pure pace there. That was amazing. In a way of it disappointed, but I don't everyone. Alex, well, you drove out really today and we didn't get it all right. As you said, on Sisions, that's our shoulders as well. But you caught back up and in a dry race, you would have finished six on merit. Either way, well done. There's some difficult conditions across this weekend. 34, I have really good points. Yeah, thanks, Sam. I think, you know, we do it that some of the quicker cars behind us, I felt a bit more risk with the pitting early thing because I could.

I would take off, yeah. I would try less, I guess, and see what it feels like. If we take half a second down, turn 10 feels pretty low in grip. Like tailwind, I think. The rear is pretty unhappy there. Yes, on the tailwind into 10, also 1 and 6 and 7 are tailwind. Okay, so we've taken off 0.5, we're going to feel one more grid. Go to the grid after this.

9149,Race,Zandvoort,40,Ayumu Iwasa,Racing Bulls,2023-08-27T14:52:28.013000+00:00,"So, most likely, the FIA will tell us which tire to use either inter or extreme, but if they don't, and if we have a choice, so the extreme could be good very initially for the rest out, but then the day will be higher than the inter. So we have seven laps remaining, and lucky to have a couple of safety car laps, so basically we'll probably have four or five rest laps remaining. So have a think, if you would like to try something, if you have a view, have a think, if you have a view, otherwise we decided for you. For me, if it's more than three laps, like more than three laps, four laps, racing, then the end is going to be better because I don't think they're going to let us race until it's conditions where the end is actually probably strong, guys. I think the end is better, but if it's like three or three laps, then the way it's better. A couple of that's, it's just because we're thinking about warm up. So the inter, I agree, will be better, but we will have a couple of safety car laps, then a couple of warm up laps, so there won't be very much of a racing at full tire temperature. That's why we are thinking about it."

So it was because of the reason for the penalty was because we impeded the pass for the PEDA because of doing the double stack. So nothing you could have done is because of the car position in the PEDA and what happened there. That was the penalty. I just wanted to know just in case it was made out. No, no, no, no. Yeah, as I tried to say, it was nothing to do with you. It was just timing in the PEDA and we did not work out. Yeah, no, no."

But yeah, we need to investigate that quickly. Could you be able to overshoot half a step on the first set? We see if we have to roll back on the second set. We try a bit more than plans for the balance. Yeah, to be honest, yes. I would like to do that. Or is it because we should have a step-up as well? Copy, it's time-by."
9153,Qualifying,Monza,40,Ayumu Iwasa,Racing Bulls,2023-09-02T14:28:04.394000+00:00,"Okay, there. So we don't need as much space on this components. Keep looking at your dash for the timings. Important bit again is to have enough gap for turn 11."

That's not clear. So. He is lost to you. He was 37. Breaking like this. But he managed to do to carry more entry and minimum speed. Then six breaking was better. And then eight. You can still break 10 meters later and try to carry more entry speed. Okay, copy that. Thank you."

So suggest more weaving. You can do more weaving at the temperature. Okay."
9157,Race,Monza,10,Pierre Gasly,Alpine,2023-09-03T13:30:17.250000+00:00,So gap to Esteban is 0.4 and everyone in a DRS train up to Albin in P6.
9157,Race,Monza,10,Pierre Gasly,Alpine,2023-09-03T13:34:15.213000+00:00,and tire temperatures are stable we're happy with what you're doing

9157,Race,Monza,14,Fernando Alonso,Aston Martin,2023-09-03T13:21:48.130000+00:00,So maximum temperature when you can on the tyres and then good lifts then a good break

Yeah, our pace was pretty good on that hard, but yeah, we'll have a look and review after the race. It feels a good job for me, or side? Yeah, but our pace was relatively good, or it was actually good on the hards. Probably we would just clear out traffic on the hard tire and then we'd destroyed the tires. I don't really know if you guys expected me to overtake Joe in that stint, but I was just, I was like a killer stint. Yeah, so on that hard, it pace was a bit worse than yesterday, but compared to others, it was competitive. So we will review it all, see what we can prove next time.

I like it, it's a good track, it's nice flow but it still needs to grip up a bit more to be more incredible."

9527,Qualifying,Montreal,18,Lance Stroll,Aston Martin,2024-06-08T20:42:57.839000+00:00,"We've had a snapping f*** turn now. Turn third turn. Six man. Yeah, a couple of you saw that. We'll have a quick look at it. So you are safe, Lance. You're through P10. Delta negative. Let's get the cover. And with that snap, like, so sh**. Just coming off the brakes of it.

9527,Qualifying,Montreal,44,Lewis Hamilton,Ferrari,2024-06-08T20:25:19.532000+00:00,"We are expecting a very light ray, but it will be light and full duration, so we will go for that one."
9527,Qualifying,Montreal,44,Lewis Hamilton,Ferrari,2024-06-08T20:33:51.117000+00:00,"Yeah, focus on exit turn two. Turn four, so take a little bit less curb."

So if the tyres are not ready, we can swap to the warm up lap approach. Yep, the way is switching off will keep me running. Can we switch off please?"
9527,Qualifying,Montreal,81,Oscar Piastri,McLaren,2024-06-08T20:27:00.206000+00:00,If we believe this light rain will last two to three minutes and then it should be a gap with that one.
9527,Qualifying,Montreal,81,Oscar Piastri,McLaren,2024-06-08T20:36:06.692000+00:00,"So the wind is from the sedric, but turn 10 realocking, consider plus 1B bow on the paddles for that comment."

9527,Qualifying,Montreal,81,Oscar Piastri,McLaren,2024-06-08T20:51:59.415000+00:00,"So, Oscar, we can do a pit stop for the second set. If you want push, pull, push on set two, then we should drive once passed from here. If you want opportunity to do four laps on that set, then we would pit this lap. We still think single call should be best."
9527,Qualifying,Montreal,81,Oscar Piastri,McLaren,2024-06-08T20:58:46.536000+00:00,"And just watch the delta, opportunity turn 1 to 1 tenth, 1 and a half tenth."

We have some standing water at the apex of turn two, but the remainder of the track is simply wet. No puddles. OK, Max. So, in turn on the rain intensity, you may notice that it picks up in intensity, but we expect that could only last around a minute or two before it reduces again."
9531,Race,Montreal,1,Max Verstappen,Red Bull Racing,2024-06-09T17:59:44.631000+00:00,"You're free to push on the throttle max to turn 13 as you need to, the tyre prep."

9534,Practice,Catalunya,44,Lewis Hamilton,Ferrari,2024-06-22T10:36:16.127000+00:00,Turn four he said two or three tenths.

You don't need to drive through but we're here if you need us.
9534,Practice,Catalunya,44,Lewis Hamilton,Ferrari,2024-06-22T10:38:29.629000+00:00,"Yeah, so looking at the... go ahead. How does it say what target? Turn, should I do? It's you were a previous lap, so they were good. No, but the second one I mean. Yeah, so 75 front and before rear is a target. And looking at the telemetry data, looks like it's more the loss at turn 5 entry, so peak braking and a mid speed."

9535,Qualifying,Catalunya,3,Daniel Ricciardo,RB,2024-06-22T14:07:03.139000+00:00,So Daniel only losses to Yuki are entry turn 4. We lose around half a tenth. Yuki is carrying bit more speed in entry and breaking minimum speed turn 14 where we also lose half a tenth. You are lifting a little bit more. I see turn 10 and turn 12 stability is still on the lower side. I would suggest to go one big forward on the offset before turn 10.
