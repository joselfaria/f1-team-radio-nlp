Nico Hulkenberg,approval,0.7056,Tires and sliding are all fine so it's okay to push more in high speed if you can.
Nico Hulkenberg,curiosity,0.4071,"Tell me a bit, how did that long run look? We're just on a little bit slower than say our Williams and Alpine.

I don't know, I'm not sure what to be honest. The last time the balance was very similar. My boxing negative staff. The last time the balance was similar across the cup.

But I'm happy with the grip, I have the high speed in general. It's a little bit stiff. I've had a very long pedal going into 13. Okay, we're having a look.

I'm already done. It's okay. Still to the finish is massive, I'm a step out. Yeah, we can't do all that."

Nico Hulkenberg,neutral,0.5942,"Well, wait a minute, we just go a little bit slow. It's a two minute out lap anyway with the start, so it's no problem. And we'll just go slow if we have to at the end. It's less than two minutes left, it'll be no problem."
Nico Hulkenberg,neutral,0.9564,"Mode slow, two burnouts start on the left hand side in Modaris."
Esteban Ocon,neutral,0.5134,"Okay, so just some lifetime differences to Pierre, so we're strong in the sector one, just losing a little bit exit 13, exit 16, 17, entry to 22, and then exit to the last corner, just a few little bits."
Esteban Ocon,neutral,0.9468,"So a bit of info on timing, Sergeant found just under a second, going on his second new soft time so we can get on this one."
Esteban Ocon,approval,0.4223,"Okay, have a think about what you'd like for balance for the next run. Did you increase the clamp? Nope, left it the same. To me, I think we should be bringing this down. Oh no, keep it the same. Okay, understood."

Max Verstappen,neutral,0.909,"Okay, so for the full managed ship, I'll add that. I've moved 12 for the dummy launch pit limiter on, so they please put limiter on. And set it by point fine, once the car is on the ground. Carry out the launch, and we are looking for a minimum of plus five on the dash, but it is plus five. I remind that from turn 20, we'll keep the booth on the control. So avoid that red icon on the dash, and then after 27, no more than 50% percent percent percent. That probably SVC bridge, looking for five long burnouts. The extra ramp rather co-sidential star position, so five long burnouts. Obvious reminder, today's stationary time much reduced, should be of the order of only 51 five seconds."

Fernando Alonso,curiosity,0.6363,"Now in your places we will lose this of safety. You read our mind, we were literally just talking about it. So if you pit now, you'd lose four. That's the two Mercedes-Benz 2 Ferrari's but Le Clareq is right on that bubble. What's your thoughts on restarting this time with 17 to go? I mean that's been good but the start of them was another level. So we'll see you see the pass either on. Copy understood. I will try to open it a bit of Martin and see how many positions we keep losing. Yes, copy that. And keep updating me on the RAS and TARLAM. So last lap was at 33.5 Russell 33.5"

Lando Norris,admiration,0.6122,"Yeah, I mean there's a tie in the middle of the track so pretty bad in my opinion. It's better just to stop in for now. I just only got a puncture on the street circuit so I'd rather they clear the debris away. There's too much debris. Yeah, great. A puncture is our concern too."

Lando Norris,neutral,0.8197,"So Lanna, this is just a bit of a question ahead. A safety car now would be very bad timing. We'd either stay out on our hard for nights, or you'd pit from medium, be 11th, and on the same tire as the cars ahead. We're after your thoughts. Probably at mid-medium."

That was a tough one, extremely well done, well done, I think without those management you do with buttons and so on, I think we probably would have lost at least one or two places there, so well done, probably need to service the steering wheel now I think. Yeah, I just think we did quite a bit of the pace, but I think we would have been much better, we were basically under fence, but I could go forwards and I think we had a good compromise, nothing we don't know."
Guanyu Zhou,neutral,0.8349,"We're sliding a lot, guys!"
Guanyu Zhou,caring,0.5596,"Yeah, how about a little bit of boxing with sliding, so they say, what we can do. To all drivers out complaining, just keep focus, stay calm, still in long race. A lot of things can happen."

Valtteri Bottas,neutral,0.9571,Check my Whats done We have got a contact
Valtteri Bottas,disapproval,0.7015,So that is obviously pretty bad for us. It didn't affect us a huge amount but obviously not the best. It's not good for those who started on Harden.
Valtteri Bottas,approval,0.6545,"Obviously a difficult race for us. Long one. Yep, yeah, sure about the... Turn two, contact to the McLaren foot. After that was so good, we were there in safety car. But yeah. Try again next week. Yep, exactly. Just one week till next race."

Sergio Perez,neutral,0.5529,Yeah.
Sergio Perez,neutral,0.6029,"Okay, main loss is the max. Look to be able to push a bit to turn one, compromising the exit through 2-3."
Sergio Perez,neutral,0.955,
Sergio Perez,neutral,0.5,some protection in the limo state and in the first sector.
Fernando Alonso,neutral,0.955,
Fernando Alonso,neutral,0.8234,You could then go straight in and get four laps continuous or you could do the next lap pushing with DRS and then do a good sergeant two behind fast sergeant one and a half.
Fernando Alonso,neutral,0.5638,So for that I'm sure you can feel it but rear tyre temperatures and pressures just keep going up and up so we think even more lift and coast will be even more lift and coast.
Fernando Alonso,neutral,0.638,"Yeah, we'll talk about all these things in the meeting later."
Charles Leclerc,approval,0.5768,"Next cap behind is at 13 seconds. Can I do a cool down and go again? Yes, yes you can."

Esteban Ocon,neutral,0.6561,"Okay, looking at the reason the big brakes last air pit and third one."
Esteban Ocon,approval,0.5929,"Okay, I'm always breaking it, looking the real slay dentry."
Esteban Ocon,neutral,0.8706,So we've got Norris Timelap for three seconds behind. We recommend the global shift forwards of break bias so half or one percent.
Esteban Ocon,neutral,0.7094,"If you can have a think about ride and balance on the way in, then we'll have a chat in the garage about what we do for the next run."
Esteban Ocon,neutral,0.9102,Some of these cars behind might keep their pace up if they're going straight into a high fuel run.
Esteban Ocon,neutral,0.3163,"Still looking the real on the pitch last corner for you, Scott? Yeah, we've just discussed that so we think you might need to go forwards bias for that corner. Unfortunately, I know it's not to your preference but for the time being."
Lewis Hamilton,neutral,0.6267,"I've got a bit of a seal to the car, no. We should just... We'll throw behind that three seconds. If not, throw. It's coming in."

Charles Leclerc,neutral,0.8456,Here I will do what goes off. Let's go again.
Charles Leclerc,neutral,0.7464,So we cannot complete a full lap if you push next lap so if you push next lap you have to come in at 10.

Sergio Perez,neutral,0.9479,I picked up some understood 7.
Sergio Perez,disappointment,0.4258,"I like a bit of rotation, it turns 7. Generally, I pick up a bit more stability in the high speed, which was positive. I'm still struggling with the rear end of braking on 11, which hurts a lot."
Sergio Perez,neutral,0.5627,"Also saying bit of a loss, 3 turns 6, track will be clear, ok on."
Sergio Perez,neutral,0.8372,It just looks like we're overpishing the entry of turn 11.
Sergio Perez,neutral,0.9545,"We are seeing you over pushing the late entry for turn one, compromising the exit."
Sergio Perez,neutral,0.9521,"until handbrake VB6. Sgt opening a lap, 4 seconds behind."
Sergio Perez,neutral,0.5311,"Okay, I think Max is going to box here, so just deal with your one for the tires."

Lewis Hamilton,neutral,0.9637,"So, Rodion throws one into the last corner."
Lewis Hamilton,neutral,0.5781,So it doesn't look like it. So no pressure from behind.
Lewis Hamilton,disappointment,0.5641,Now we lose and down the straight.
Lewis Hamilton,confusion,0.7751,A little bit difficult to tell. There was the lock up into the final corner that cost a look about 4-5-10s.

Fernando Alonso,caring,0.5793,So the safest thing is to come in now.
Fernando Alonso,neutral,0.8747,So we think we'll just get this one time lap and then it may be range so this lap you're still all clear behind it 13 seconds back to the stop.
Fernando Alonso,neutral,0.892,Now I suspect there's only one lap on these tyres before the damage put let's see.

It will be good to come in and think about the next run. Do you think you really need another lap on this? No, no, no, good. Let's take the blank for last corner. Copy that. Okay, so let's box now, please, box now. We'll have an arrow cruise after turn 10 if we can."

Carlos Sainz,neutral,0.9621,There are five time-lapse to go to the handle the session.
Oscar Piastri,neutral,0.9424,"So Oscar you'll have time for two laps, you can use Strat 2 for maximum deployment on the first or Strat 5 to spread the deployment between them. 8 seconds gap behind, so Per is time to find to turn 9 and 10."
Max Verstappen,anger,0.5279,Hey what the f*** is going on with the car? Don't rip! It's fitting everything everywhere!

Lando Norris,neutral,0.4491,"Ok, I know, we are thinking to fit a fit and new set of interest in this lap. That will give you time to do fast, slow, fast. Keep your speed up on the way in. If you don't agree with that plan, let me know. This difficult is trying quite a bit."

Max Verstappen,neutral,0.9153,"Okay, first thing is weather update. That cell that I set to be hitting around 10 laps into the race that look quite short and sharp, that is maybe breaking up a little bit or at least using it intensity. So I'll keep the update to the first four laps of the race. May world is something we can drive through this day now, but it's a board looking like it. I'm going to require the first switch to it. Okay, full vehicle out presentation. Bo 12, the W-Lawton. Pit limiter off and a static 5.5, 1st car is on the ground. Carry out, the practice starts at 30 years normal and then through the full vehicle out. Target as much, tire warming as possible. Lift the coast, it's 1013 and half the 1013, no more. It's 10% trouble. Turn the burn out from the left hand side, fire-mire-carb, post. That's just before the final painted criss-cross. To the left hand side, fire-mire-carb, post. We are looking for four locks, burn-out, four lock burn-outs and an extra ramp rather than a coach of ours, your start position. At least 4.5, any changes I will communicate to you."
Max Verstappen,approval,0.6153,"You can live with it, stay up. You need to tell me the way down. Yeah, I'm just a fact. I think we'll be at this light box."
Max Verstappen,neutral,0.7677,"Okay, so all cars are now back on slicks. Car behind us. Check out three seconds. So think about the time management, please Max. Time management."
Max Verstappen,approval,0.2867,"Delta Latte Tire to check out two and a half tents. There's another two and a half tents worth of saving that you were doing instead of eight, because it's working well, so keep it up."
Max Verstappen,neutral,0.9527,R&T There's a差... just continues to provide that
Max Verstappen,neutral,0.5832,"Okay, Max, expecting some very light rain in around five, six minutes. It will hit turn 8 and 13, but it is very light."
Max Verstappen,neutral,0.9112,"So we are expected braid around 10 laps from the end max, some of which could be pretty heavy."
Max Verstappen,confusion,0.6807,Is it gonna be like extreme terror or into? It could say the moment I guess.
Max Verstappen,neutral,0.9263,box 16 dad oh you said your name.
Max Verstappen,approval,0.4943,I think this would be a very good time to pit. Okay.
Max Verstappen,neutral,0.4716,"Really you tech? Loud and clear Max. That's three and a half minutes until the race resumes for you. Now in one and a half minutes the laps cars will leave the pit lane. We'll then move you back into the pass lane once they've all left the pit lane. You will then follow the safe car out eventually. I can confirm it is a rolling start procedure. The safe car will stay out for two laps, two laps. That would lead six racing laps."
Max Verstappen,neutral,0.834,"and turn this first lap behind the safety car max, but I could also use all gears just to make sure we were safe, sick. If you can."
Max Verstappen,neutral,0.9289,"It's home for weather update, maybe some light rain expected in six, seven minutes, Max. It is only light."
Max Verstappen,neutral,0.9618,you all the way around.
Logan Sargeant,confusion,0.7485,"You okay? No, I crashed. I don't know what happened to man. Something fell on the front right when I hit the curb. When I hit the curb."

Lando Norris,annoyance,0.7582,"Yeah, but I'm just so f**king annoying the better self. I can't do it."
Lando Norris,remorse,0.3391,"I'm going to need to change my helmet and everything anyway so it's fun to get out. It's so raining so it's not going to restart anytime soon. Were you talking? Like I didn't hear anything. Can you hear me? No. Yeah, no, no. Okay, sorry, we are losing the connection on my belt pack. You can jump out. Yeah, okay."
Lando Norris,admiration,0.5828,"Yeah, not our best, executed rice, obviously, but still some points on the board about both of us well done, but you know, we need to do better. Yeah, I like to review. But still, P2 and Kualaise, so a lot of good things, we want to make a perfect, so just keep pushing. Sure. Don't mind, still, you're in the structures when you come to stop."

Pierre Gasly,neutral,0.9046,"I can't really see a thing in the street. Okay, we go in yellow tone 1, yellow tone 1. Press off."
Pierre Gasly,neutral,0.8424,"So mid-trees available, mid-trees available, press under investigation for speeding in a pit lane so you want to stay within five seconds if you can."
Pierre Gasly,admiration,0.9533,That's what I like baby. That's what I like. Really good race. Really good race. You guys can be proud very well executed. And you mate. Nice job. Very nice job. So really one for the team this one. Awesome job. Awesome job. Thank you.
Sergio Perez,neutral,0.6929,"Okay, we're seeing a strong tailwind in to turn 10. Think about the push toggle for turn 10."
Sergio Perez,neutral,0.8468,"Okay, gap to Russell 14 seconds. Russell the first car on the slick tire."
Sergio Perez,neutral,0.9577,"Give back 100 cutters. Yes, back 100 cutters."
Sergio Perez,disappointment,0.2528,Okay so there's light rain on the staff industry. This is a bad little cap.
Sergio Perez,curiosity,0.7273,"Is there more rain expected? There are cells on the radar, first one 35 minutes away."
Sergio Perez,admiration,0.7599,"So it will be flat here, not from here. Yeah, the bike will be some great in 15 laps, a great 25 laps. Hard to say how strong that will be at this point."
Sergio Perez,admiration,0.9143,"So it will be planned ahead from here. Yeah, the bike is great in 15 laps, a great 25 laps. Hard to say how strong that will be at this point."
Sergio Perez,neutral,0.3734,"I cleave the wall on the entry to the pit lane with the right hand. Copy? On the right. Copy, we'll have a look. What was it? Just the tire from wing. Do the tire. Okay. We'll get some first rubber on anyway. So are we going back a lap or not? Stand by will let you know when we have all the details. That's the normal thing. So we've done it before."
Sergio Perez,neutral,0.9467,"I could check us out, we've got the Intertire fit, and everyone is on the Inter."
Sergio Perez,disappointment,0.3518,Hard like check out unfortunately the speeding was on the way into the bit lane for the red flag. I think it was a good drive today. It was a good drive. I think they call on that first lap. What a shame. Sorry the tyres weren't really on the second one which was a late call but we were very late.
Fernando Alonso,confusion,0.7106,A little bit of rain about five minutes away. We're not totally sure how hard it is but there's definitely some. Let's start the race.
Fernando Alonso,neutral,0.5169,"So we expect the heaviest drain is going to come, but it hits sector three in about one minute time. So it could be on this first lap. We'll keep you updated. So keep an eye on your grid box position when you line up."
Fernando Alonso,neutral,0.6419,"Yes, raining a bit harder now in the pit lane. We are ready. Maybe in the... It's only two or three minutes this, two or three minutes."
Fernando Alonso,approval,0.6586,"Yeah, the moment with faster interest. Yeah, definitely. I think we only expect two or three minutes of this, but it's definitely wet now. Okay, so we can wait. Okay, so we've been is getting lighter now. Can we survive it? You think? Definitely, yes, yes. Yeah, copy. So definitely care for the level now. Smooth tarmac. Okay, it's you less knows you come in, but it's still raining a bit to the pen and bit of lighter. We. I think I don't know. I can survive. It's what I mean. So do you follow those other cars?"
Fernando Alonso,neutral,0.7286,"It was gasoline soon. I know what burns come from. Yeah, so everybody's on soft tyres except Joe. Joe was on the mediums. If a padded was not in in our pipe."
Fernando Alonso,neutral,0.9486,"Just while we've got time, just take your air balance thoughts on that first partner."
Fernando Alonso,neutral,0.6179,"Okay, so you're doing similar lap times to gazilee perisipol away a little bit That rain we talked about earlier is about 15 minutes away, but it's very light. So we don't think it'll affect"
Fernando Alonso,neutral,0.9402,So Russell's the only car on hard ties. He's getting he's dropping back his P17 and not making his way through cars
Fernando Alonso,neutral,0.8942,"We can wait for gas, we can't fit, and he's getting a self-decade like this. Yeah, he's a gas, he has fitted. Now, gas is just fitted. Won't be long now for us."
Fernando Alonso,admiration,0.9491,So there is a small chance of rain at about ten laps. I'll keep you updated. Good job mate. Good job. Good copy. Good job guys. Got a flying.
Fernando Alonso,neutral,0.7901,When the rain comes it will be heavier than the start of the race.
Fernando Alonso,approval,0.6769,"Yeah, depth level here is good for none of them. Sure, there will be rain."
Fernando Alonso,neutral,0.5778,So maybe in eight minutes there's some very light rain but nothing serious.
Fernando Alonso,neutral,0.9522,"It's a possible debris 10-11-12 overhead, possible debris 11-12."
Fernando Alonso,admiration,0.8954,"That's it mate, P2, well done. I think that's my favourite one. The fast is that as well. Yeah, I think this one, I'll start the first one yet. But we will win one race soon. We have to get closer. Well done guys."
Fernando Alonso,admiration,0.6011,"So happy mate. I thought we could have a go in my one but we didn't have any chance that I was ready to try. Yeah, well done. Well done mate."
Charles Leclerc,neutral,0.5239,"So slightly better than previous lap, slower everywhere, just turn 10, you are faster than him. But we are talking small, something small. And we have wind phase 728, similar to FP2."
Charles Leclerc,neutral,0.8179,And more raining in expected in six laps light intensity.
Charles Leclerc,neutral,0.968,my number is
Charles Leclerc,neutral,0.8879,And we are expecting drops to a light shower in around 10 minutes.
Charles Leclerc,disappointment,0.2727,"So the situation is getting worse, so we retire the car. We retire."
Lance Stroll,neutral,0.6627,"Okay, last up was within our numbers turn seven management turn seven management within our target. It's a strong tailwind there. It's 15 up to 20 kph in seven tailwind."
Lance Stroll,neutral,0.7333,"Ok, let's make some space before turn one and then lean on the tyres up to turn two."
Lance Stroll,neutral,0.8988,"Braining harder, talk 11th."
Lance Stroll,approval,0.5616,"That's what's cool, that's what's cool. He's delta positive. We've done 18 laps last, a long way to go. There's more rain coming. June feels this is the best tire for the conditions. We think this is the best tire for the conditions and the context of the race. Make sure your brakes are working well."
Lance Stroll,amusement,0.8212,"Radio off-talking low speed Who's not all the tires it's funny Lecflair, boys, let's all go"
Lance Stroll,neutral,0.8096,"Okay, Lance, 13 to go, 13 to go. Other teams thinking extreme wet. It could be extreme wet. We're considering it."
Lance Stroll,neutral,0.9487,"and it's going to be expecting two laps behind the safety car launch. Keep the tyre temp up as much as you can, tyres and brakes."
Kevin Magnussen,neutral,0.7266,"Okay, Kev, boxing this lap. Do you want to front wing adjustment? No front wing adjusts, no front wing adjusts. Copy that, so driving through the pit lanes do another lap."
Kevin Magnussen,neutral,0.7743,Expecting the most intense rain turn 1314.
Kevin Magnussen,neutral,0.8835,"But we still need to pit if we get a cab because if it's a small rain then these tires are going to be Copy, understood"
Kevin Magnussen,remorse,0.7878,"Use wet patches where possible, use wet patches where possible and VC1, please VC1. I'm not hearing anything about the gap dude. Sorry, the gap to stopping you'll come out in front of standby. You'll come out P12 if you stop now."
Kevin Magnussen,neutral,0.964,"for reference, Kevin. Nico's carrying ball speed through 7-8 and 13 just for reference."
Kevin Magnussen,neutral,0.9072,Hamilton has DRS you do not
Kevin Magnussen,neutral,0.7859,"Need to get into Joe's DRS if possible, Kev. He has DRS from PS3 unfortunately."
Kevin Magnussen,neutral,0.9093,"possible rain in 15 minutes, possible rain in 15 minutes."
Kevin Magnussen,neutral,0.9201,"So entering the pit lane and stopping in order, there are still eight laps to go at the end of this one."
Kevin Magnussen,approval,0.592,"Okay, so it's intermediate tires for the restart behind the safety cut."
Kevin Magnussen,approval,0.4974,"Yeah, I guess you've had two laps behind the safety car and then a rolling start."
Yuki Tsunoda,neutral,0.9507,"Something got on me, check me. Copy."
Yuki Tsunoda,caring,0.8328,"Are you okay? The rain is coming last corner. If it's every rain, we are happy you to call the box."
Yuki Tsunoda,neutral,0.5401,"And 0 grip. And 1, 1, 1, basic thing, whatever. I go 5 seconds for contact with Racer. Yeah, of course, they got a gaping. But, of course."
Alexander Albon,neutral,0.9507,"Alex, we have a slow left front puncture."
Alexander Albon,curiosity,0.6542,Can we also just check my seat? Is there a bit of heat coming up from around my bump?
Alexander Albon,desire,0.4169,6 cars have picked up it into but our aim is still to survive. Just 3 laps.
Alexander Albon,admiration,0.9136,"and then Magnuson behind on Inter. So Alex is really good, these guys are going to have to pit again soon for dry."
Alexander Albon,neutral,0.9622,"HPP on, HPP on, and some people are now hitting back on to drives, taking a struggle with warmup."
Alexander Albon,neutral,0.8318,"So starting lap 21, our current plan is plan B plus 10, plan B plus 10, but that should be achievable."
Alexander Albon,anger,0.6454,"What the f*** was that? Give a copy out, it's a B-Sort, we're on it."
Alexander Albon,neutral,0.3899,"What the f*** was that? Copy Alex, we saw it, we're on it. Alex, we've reported it, let's just get him next lap."
Alexander Albon,admiration,0.9446,Alex went a really good place so we're still extending this is an awesome job.
Alexander Albon,neutral,0.8352,"Okay, Alex here now P8 Hamilton and PS3 pity behind us. Cara head his Russell four seconds on a really used hard. So at the moment Alex we think we're racing for P6. So P6 is on. Keep me updated about pace. Copy. If you keep doing 15 zeros that's perfect. Let's say quick thrust. Okay, copy will discuss it."
Alexander Albon,neutral,0.9624,...
Alexander Albon,neutral,0.867,"So Alex, we're going to get at least 10 minutes warning if you want to jump out of the car depend."
Alexander Albon,remorse,0.7687,"So sorry about all those changes, I think I had to put a few tries to prepare the car for these conditions, which one gets much temp as we could. We've got another couple more, ready for the restart. So can you go green 9 position 7 please? And then when I've done green 8 position 1, then tyre switch to inter, which may change to full wet later on."
Alexander Albon,neutral,0.9637,mode 9 when you can for performance
Alexander Albon,gratitude,0.4537,"Yeah, that's checkered flag, checkered flag. So P8. Yes, why don't everyone? That was a tough race. I think I could have done a bit better on that second call to pick there, but I mean, we've got really strong pace. We should be very proud of that. There was even P6 on pure pace there. That was amazing. In a way of it disappointed, but I don't everyone. Alex, well, you drove out really today and we didn't get it all right. As you said, on Sisions, that's our shoulders as well. But you caught back up and in a dry race, you would have finished six on merit. Either way, well done. There's some difficult conditions across this weekend. 34, I have really good points. Yeah, thanks, Sam. I think, you know, we do it that some of the quicker cars behind us, I felt a bit more risk with the pitting early thing because I could. Yeah, a couple of, you know, we'll review it. But in the meantime, I told you we're going to come here and finish eight feet with a bit of my arm off and bottom. Thank you. Why didn't everyone?"
Nico Hulkenberg,curiosity,0.4383,"Do you want to flap a just Nico? Not really, but it's new sticky tires. Let's maybe try in which way would you go? I would take off, yeah. I would try less, I guess, and see what it feels like. If we take half a second down, turn 10 feels pretty low in grip. Like tailwind, I think. The rear is pretty unhappy there. Yes, on the tailwind into 10, also 1 and 6 and 7 are tailwind. Okay, so we've taken off 0.5, we're going to feel one more grid. Go to the grid after this. Close the radio rear."
Nico Hulkenberg,neutral,0.9373,"Press In button, cool the car, go to the grid, test your drink and a static fight point learn when you arrive on the grid. See you there."
Nico Hulkenberg,approval,0.7833,"So whether I wise there is rain building, sometimes it disappears, so we're kind of prepared for that with our tire choice. Okay, and then we went through all the data and what we're happening with our tires, we've reverted the maps degree adjust. It was just too much, it took out too much front, and then we've corrected for the tire compounds for the race start. So we basically used the first lap, first lap air balance, and then just corrected for the delta for the tire. Yeah, that's correct."
Nico Hulkenberg,neutral,0.6847,In two or three minutes we'll probably have light drizzle for a few minutes.
Nico Hulkenberg,optimism,0.6558,"Okay, that's two times past safety car line one, so you can catch the pack. The main pack is going into seven. Okay, Nico, good job on brakes. You're with the pack now. So the people who have stopped is bot-tests on to medium, stroll on to medium, you and loss on to medium and Russell's going on to hard. Other people have not stopped yet. They're all still on soft. The next rain, if it comes, would be in like 25 laps. So we'll see what happens there. Otherwise, we'll just see how long we can take this tire."
Nico Hulkenberg,neutral,0.955,
Nico Hulkenberg,approval,0.435,"He used 1010, he's unbelievable. And I know I was a 5 left left, don't say. Yeah, understood. Maybe try 10 without the left toggle just to see what it does."
Nico Hulkenberg,neutral,0.9533,The Albon will be coming out on the medium.
Nico Hulkenberg,admiration,0.4047,"Turned 7-8 was good, it's 4, and then with the rain coming like 9 laps away, let's make this tire for 9 laps to get the lap time out of it."
Nico Hulkenberg,neutral,0.7856,"We may have dropped soon, the big rain is 5 minutes away."
Nico Hulkenberg,admiration,0.8751,"Great job, Nico. Just tell us everything you can about the conditions. We want to get on the right tire at the right time."
Nico Hulkenberg,neutral,0.9591,Box now Nico box now
Nico Hulkenberg,approval,0.6272,"Yeah, loud and clear. Okay, so it's restarting on an inter. We go two minutes early, along with all these people to unlapped ourselves. There will be two total laps under the safety car, and then six racing laps remaining after that. Okay, so we're still on our interbalance and inter switches, which is all fine."
Nico Hulkenberg,admiration,0.773,"It's not much possible there. I mean, could go this way, these guys, but not overtake. Yeah, copy that, man. It's a good job today by you. It's really good overtakes in the dry too. And then, yeah, you did what we could. So P12."
Esteban Ocon,neutral,0.4105,"Okay, so it will be recharge on at turn 7 this time. How's the balance, please? How's the gain, Super? Okay, keep your pace up and go to the grid, please. Go to the grid. Okay, and if you can test your drinks kit, if you haven't already as well. Okay, go to the back of the grid. Come to a stop and go to P1."
Esteban Ocon,neutral,0.6952,"Okay mate half the field have not pitted, they're all bunched up between 11 and 13, we can get a load of people here."
Esteban Ocon,neutral,0.954,"Safety car, safety car, stay out, stay out."
Esteban Ocon,neutral,0.9068,There's a bit of a weird shift 617 under the corner. Copy that oil level.
Esteban Ocon,approval,0.6291,"Okay, some of these switch changes are related to that shift. We're trying to improve it."
Esteban Ocon,neutral,0.898,The science in front has pitted that puts us P6 at the moment.
Esteban Ocon,neutral,0.5414,"How are we doing, Max Push on these tyres? Status three for now, please. Norris 1.4 behind, 26 laps to go."
Esteban Ocon,neutral,0.8655,possible rain in 15 minutes only like
Esteban Ocon,neutral,0.4386,"This is going to be very, very heavy rain estimate, massive."
Esteban Ocon,neutral,0.5708,"Okay, maybe we need scenario 5. This is going to be extremely heavy rain. It's going to get much much heavier."
Esteban Ocon,neutral,0.9609,Please
Esteban Ocon,approval,0.4944,"Okay, and that is the check of the flag. As you finished, P10, the front paris got a penalty before speeding in the pit lane before everything restarted again. So that puts P3rd, C4 out here. She's good for the tingle."
Ayumu Iwasa,approval,0.7165,"So, most likely, the FIA will tell us which tire to use either inter or extreme, but if they don't, and if we have a choice, so the extreme could be good very initially for the rest out, but then the day will be higher than the inter. So we have seven laps remaining, and lucky to have a couple of safety car laps, so basically we'll probably have four or five rest laps remaining. So have a think, if you would like to try something, if you have a view, have a think, if you have a view, otherwise we decided for you. For me, if it's more than three laps, like more than three laps, four laps, racing, then the end is going to be better because I don't think they're going to let us race until it's conditions where the end is actually probably strong, guys. I think the end is better, but if it's like three or three laps, then the way it's better. A couple of that's, it's just because we're thinking about warm up. So the inter, I agree, will be better, but we will have a couple of safety car laps, then a couple of warm up laps, so there won't be very much of a racing at full tire temperature. That's why we are thinking about it."
Ayumu Iwasa,disapproval,0.494,"What was the penalty for the PEDA? So it was because of the reason for the penalty was because we impeded the pass for the PEDA because of doing the double stack. So nothing you could have done is because of the car position in the PEDA and what happened there. That was the penalty. I just wanted to know just in case it was made out. No, no, no, no. Yeah, as I tried to say, it was nothing to do with you. It was just timing in the PEDA and we did not work out. Yeah, no, no."
Ayumu Iwasa,neutral,0.8947,"So now we have a break in the rain, we have a break in the rain, it's stopping on next one expected in 15 minutes from now, 15 to 20 minutes."
Ayumu Iwasa,neutral,0.6753,"Okay, that's the 8 minutes warning for you Liam. 8 minutes warning restart in 10 minutes and we will exit the bit and in 8."
Ayumu Iwasa,neutral,0.8208,We will do 2 laps beyond the safety car on then 5 rest flaps. Everyone will be on the inter. We have done as much as we could to help you with tires on brakes. We bring it to the bag.
Ayumu Iwasa,joy,0.6017,"Okay, so you keep going to penalty on that P13 for you today. P13, good and bad. Good and bad. I think you should be pleased. Cool. Yeah, considering the amount of time that we lost at the start. Yeah. Get your own. I enjoyed that. Okay, glad you enjoyed it. Still a lot of work ahead. We'll get ready again. Unfortunately, the penalty is very unfortunate. But you did all the right things today. We'll review the details for next time. Yeah, for sure. At the very last, I started to get a bit more over feeling on the soft. I got clean. Yeah. That medium said I didn't feel very comfortable on. But I started to get more of an understanding on that soft. Yeah, I hope that on the we wanted to try something on the medium because there were not too much to lose. But yeah, the soft was a good compound."
Lewis Hamilton,optimism,0.4811,"We should have come in, man. This is very wet. Copy, Lewis. So we're going to stay out. We're going to have to brave this, I think."
Lewis Hamilton,curiosity,0.6041,Do you have reports that LeClerc may have had some damage so missing some of the rear downforce? Do you hear me? LeClerc car head. He was a 1.7 slower than the previous 8th car.
Lewis Hamilton,disappointment,0.4233,"I'll soon lose next card, Norris, or one second ahead."
Lewis Hamilton,neutral,0.9651,market income recovery
Lewis Hamilton,admiration,0.8675,"No, sir, he gives a balance check. Very good. A bit of a lot of things."
Lewis Hamilton,neutral,0.77,So this rain is looking imminent and it will be heavy so you can use the tyres.
Lewis Hamilton,neutral,0.6612,"So, I'll join to last part from a much different time strategy team. Yep, we try to get the message to him. Should be this straight."
Lewis Hamilton,neutral,0.9498,in England. What's
Lewis Hamilton,gratitude,0.9339,"That was a Hexic one, so yeah, P6 final position. Really great drive and yeah, let's say Hexic day. Thanks a lot, guys. So the job done with the best stops. Thank you for the hard work. Let's keep it up and fight. It's not the day we wanted. Yeah, yeah, right on the Lus, not the day we wanted, but we'll keep battling on."
Carlos Sainz,neutral,0.8606,"Now we've born with phase 7, from with phase 5. Ok, bring down the bar."
Carlos Sainz,neutral,0.6952,"And pass as a front wing damage, front wing jump damage for charge. Okay, don't slow me down please."
Carlos Sainz,neutral,0.8846,They look like they made a 9 big accident.
Carlos Sainz,neutral,0.8019,And no more rain for the next 30 minutes.
Carlos Sainz,neutral,0.4113,"Yeah, very difficult to capture with this safety gun."
Carlos Sainz,neutral,0.5172,"looksphrased either like Van Bush, to the whole tournament Do you copy? here"
Carlos Sainz,neutral,0.8023,We also believe that the track is speaking up after the safety car in the rain.
Carlos Sainz,neutral,0.8998,"And I alive for the softest plus 10, plus 10. You left kick, we got back into the end. At the moment we don't think, but we are monitoring."
Carlos Sainz,nervousness,0.3537,"How many more laps at this pace? At this pace, 10 more laps. But I'm worried about that. It's costly. It's going to go away. That's good. There's only 3.8 in front."

George Russell,neutral,0.9528,current expecting two laps behind the safety car and we have the inter tyre fitted that was mandatory from the FIA
George Russell,curiosity,0.5815,"For info there is more light rain on the radar, five minutes out. So it will be a rolling start procedure. The safety car will end with a hit lane end of this one. Can you put the noise on board on your screen? Let me know if he's inside or outside. Down the sound tray. I think it's going to be too delayed to be of any use to you. I'll try and keep an R on GPS and let you know."
George Russell,neutral,0.7108,ali Yeah
Valtteri Bottas,neutral,0.6632,"40 minutes ago, 40 minutes all cars on great except Magnuson, the race start will be tried."
Valtteri Bottas,neutral,0.9485,25 minutes to go 25 there is a shower west of to the circuit which is closing in and chup pass the circuit where we might feel some drops
Valtteri Bottas,neutral,0.8975,about to take a few drops of rain but nothing major.
Valtteri Bottas,neutral,0.9677,Couple of drops here of whatever was the forrogous thing
Valtteri Bottas,neutral,0.6923,"Okay, that's Hayasa. Oh, and now I'll study the work."
Valtteri Bottas,approval,0.4598,"Okay, so that was B17 for us in the end. Yeah, copy. So it is fairly good. One up again and faction. It's only getting better at the last two laps. But yeah, like I said, we've missed a bigger opportunity today in the beginning. Yep, understood. I can vouch you correction on the B15. So you know that I had a penalty and there was a rustle behind."
Oscar Piastri,neutral,0.8885,"Class hall right in the bit lane. Yeah, some load drops as well on the visor."
Oscar Piastri,neutral,0.8293,I may have a massive flat squat now. Copy.
Oscar Piastri,admiration,0.896,but that looks good
Oscar Piastri,neutral,0.6403,"How's the trot? Still OK, put it out. No change."
Oscar Piastri,neutral,0.8005,POSCO there's another shower approaching expected around lap 60 possibly later it has grown in intensity would last the remainder of the race.
Oscar Piastri,admiration,0.7789,"I think if you missed opportunities, sorry for the lock up. That's nice to recover back to the points. And yeah, back at it again next week. So, have some fun. Yeah, good job. Good job today. Jover really well."
Max Verstappen,gratitude,0.9899,"by the Onesit, thank you."
Logan Sargeant,neutral,0.6745,"Okay. Those lab remember like cross target plus then we take a double slow focus on dropping the rear no but behind. I'm a clock on balance. Do you need a lap adjust? Yeah, I'm 2.2 high speed. I think minus 1.5. A bit. I feel like my change of direction in the chicane are a little bit lazy. Copy. Now green 8 p11 please. First cap pushing to go bitch up to 4. What am I targeting? It's targeting plus 10 dropping rear and we are boxing going through complaints. Topping block. Flap adjust 1.5 down."
Logan Sargeant,curiosity,0.7559,How many turns of slap did you take out? Super pipe.
Logan Sargeant,neutral,0.9279,"that 7, increase the like, or turn 6, 7, 8."
Lando Norris,admiration,0.7832,"Yeah, oh good. Oh, good. Lot of guys living in the pit behind you. Remember, no carbs, no D.R.S."
Lando Norris,admiration,0.533,"And you have already done H 13 version 5, but that's good. It will be 1 plus 1 burn out, a standard on left hand side."
Sergio Perez,neutral,0.5603,The Fred toe we have in Havatt toe. Yep.
Sergio Perez,neutral,0.7903,a balance update we are losing our video from left but we are not too much okay think about turn 6-7 yeah on the uphill hill
Fernando Alonso,joy,0.7479,"If you want to go back to Tired Dry S you can or if you're happy with Dite where you are we're happy to say. Happy Nade. Okay, copy."
Fernando Alonso,neutral,0.9638,Long time flakes.
Charles Leclerc,curiosity,0.5093,So can you repeat what you said? Did not copy? I would like to stay out to call the telephone. There is a chance that the chat is with God. Good on us. Copy the student.
Charles Leclerc,neutral,0.9492,"And just in case you need it, behind Hamilton does a gap of 8 seconds to Hulkenberg."
Kevin Magnussen,remorse,0.7027,"I'm shifting too late into Zempo. In Zempo. I don't know what that means. Zempo. I'm not upshifting into Zempo. Zempo. Okay. We're apparently you are upshifting with wheel spin and that is the problem, sorry for the lack of clarity."
Kevin Magnussen,approval,0.5076,"Okay, Kev, lifting coastal all good. Please try managing the traction phase of turn six a little bit more on the next lap."
Kevin Magnussen,neutral,0.9219,"Ok, get practice bit entry, stop on the marks, the guys will do a tyre change and then P1 please."
Yuki Tsunoda,neutral,0.6043,"Okay, let's go."
Yuki Tsunoda,confusion,0.6742,"I think I had a bit of real looking end of the breaking turn one, isn't it?"
Yuki Tsunoda,neutral,0.9075,"My third quarter, inside Wilbur, from 10th rear, in middle of the 10th. Copy, nothing we can do now, but we'll have a look."
Yuki Tsunoda,gratitude,0.8001,"I can't keep up the pace in the in-lap. Yeah, in general I feel like inside the bouncing and the source becomes especially. And this doesn't make sense. Understood. Also, initial turning stability is not that great as well. Copy you, OK. Thank you for the patience please for a bit of time."
Yuki Tsunoda,approval,0.6456,"Ok, we see on the stir-fry speed, I would like to do a flapp of just, do you agree? Yeah, we can do that."
Yuki Tsunoda,neutral,0.6346,Hamitun don't know how to move away. Copy.
Alexander Albon,curiosity,0.7223,"You still happy on doubles? Yeah, thinking about through the pit lane, doubles as a result. Yeah, so do you need a flap adjust? Do you have it? Oh, I'm interested to go two turns down just to see what it happens. I'll put that. So we'll come through the pits, stuff in the box for a flap adjust, and that would be one more time. I think the soft tire is about second lap tire at the moment."
Guanyu Zhou,confusion,0.6229,"I have a problem, I don't know how I can go in because ery is my port of clutch, it goes in to anti-store."
Guanyu Zhou,excitement,0.5685,I bought the car and I crazy guys. I crazy. I got no idea.
Guanyu Zhou,neutral,0.9538,"We stay out to take the flank for practice time on the grid, watch for a stop and then press or pushing high fuel."
Nico Hulkenberg,neutral,0.955,
Nico Hulkenberg,neutral,0.7677,"Okay, safety cars ending, it will be VSC still no overtaking, we're going around to the creek for practice start, loads slow."
Esteban Ocon,approval,0.6096,"Okay, make clear track behind any initial balance comments so far please. Initial comment balance, the traction into two not great. The front end and the grip on the way is an entry and all that's not too bad. So yeah, pretty good for the way. Okay, that's good."
Esteban Ocon,neutral,0.5902,"Okay, it's about at the end of this lap. Keep pushing to term one without DRS, please."
Esteban Ocon,neutral,0.588,"Ok, big top on this Dn2, done 5. Can you press the OK button twice please, that's to bad."
Esteban Ocon,neutral,0.8534,"Okay, so when that's the check of flags, so recharge on, please recharge on. There will be the same safety car test that they did last week, so you'll see safety car deployed shortly on your dash. Follow the delta when that happens, please. And then can we go to display four, please display four to show attempts."
Esteban Ocon,neutral,0.6068,"If the VSC is still active, I'd still like you to keep us close to the Delta as possible. I'm going to try and stop both cars, Paris, just behind you so we need to make a cap."
Felipe Drugovich,neutral,0.4652,"So if you can just go over a minute to go, for one minute fifteen you've got my car with a rake ahead of you, so they're likely to be in constant speed so if you can clear them it will help us."
Felipe Drugovich,neutral,0.9139,You're going to go cool all the cars behind the fast to Perez to behind fast.
Felipe Drugovich,neutral,0.8043,"Okay, for lip-8 we're going to cool. Start two in the background, cool the start two in the background. We're going to give you something for turn one with the tool, stand by, focus on the rear left, cool it down."
Felipe Drugovich,neutral,0.9432,"So, flip a, we're calling now to call and we'll do one more push so tire black E, tire black E."
Felipe Drugovich,neutral,0.5808,"So, Felipe, we're going to do a pit stop. You're going to box with a pit stop then they're going to roll you forward and you stop Fernando behind and then we'll wheel you in the garage once Fernando stops Don, okay? Yeah, I got it. Yeah, so you can use Go one for brake balance, attack the pit entry, stop on the mark, static pit stop and then engine off and they'll roll you forward."
Ayumu Iwasa,neutral,0.8105,"Okay, compared to the other car it was U10s in turn 8. So same breaking point, but carrying less speed in the late entry into turn 8, but then it's ISO 910, so it's all in turn 8. On Yuki is using 4th gear in turn 8. Yuki using 4th gear at the moment in turn 8."
Ayumu Iwasa,curiosity,0.497,"Okay, Liam, so tires might struggle for one more, but what's your preference? Do you want to try one more? Or we move to the long run? I think we can move the long run. I don't think that's ice. Even on this lap, I had a lot of a lot of this peak. Copy that. So it's a turn one one and a half times on turn eight mid to exit seven months."
Ayumu Iwasa,neutral,0.9261,"And same with those before 5kph, telluinton1."
Lewis Hamilton,gratitude,0.6567,"Okay, copy. Thanks for that. You've got to see No. 2 behind. 5.5 on a time. Let's see, you want to continue? I have to get with the long run. It's about time. Let's see, you want to continue? I have to get with the long run. It's about time."
George Russell,remorse,0.7169,"So vibration of the steering and the braking, just put the magic, the marker, sorry. Yeah, if I'm going to do that. And again, into the 7. I see the marker."
George Russell,excitement,0.469,Happyczynny two
George Russell,neutral,0.6391,"Yeah, A-Ferm, we do see that."
George Russell,neutral,0.9638,"Change the front right side up, just to review after."
Valtteri Bottas,neutral,0.8137,"Keep getting on the stall, immediately. Okay, copy."
Valtteri Bottas,neutral,0.7678,"Okay, so we have as a reference Norris in a 23-2 on soft, Peris still on 9 seconds behind, and mode push, mode push."
Valtteri Bottas,disappointment,0.2764,"Something is wrong with the rear end, medium with high speed, there's zero crypt, it feels like something is stalling."
Valtteri Bottas,neutral,0.4654,I think we're going to box and fix this issue that car is undrivable. The rear-ended high-speed is something installing.
Valtteri Bottas,neutral,0.612,"Okay, you are clearly on traffic behind and tires are on target. Mode push when you're ready and we try again."
Valtteri Bottas,approval,0.3912,"And you confirm the car is better than our question? Yes, better."
Valtteri Bottas,neutral,0.9639,"After you peel away from the pit stop, if you can, mode formation lap 1 burn out."
Valtteri Bottas,neutral,0.9275,Next one behind would be Hamilton High fuel still 9 seconds and try to re-learn the gears on the cell level.
Oscar Piastri,neutral,0.6138,"And after on the in-lap I'd like to do some CSLs. The first is 240kph out of turns 7. So if you can have it a clear track ahead that's better data. And that would be purple to the 7 position, who for 240kph and 6th gear."
Oscar Piastri,curiosity,0.7251,"Orange talk, can, orange talk, can. How's the time? We're in struggle at now. Do you think we can learn anything by changing the rear wing setting? I think I make a more of a pre-peach."
Max Verstappen,neutral,0.9584,That middle pattern is tracking trajectory with the traffic. It gets via this gas station.
Max Verstappen,annoyance,0.4116,"I'm not going to try again because I had a f***ing read. It's not qualified max. Box please. Yeah, I know that one term from the read."
Max Verstappen,neutral,0.7183,"just look out checkers, he's off the track for the moment, but he's looking to come on track. He's clear for now. Red for like works. Dash positive."
Max Verstappen,curiosity,0.3814,"Did you learn anything? No, not really. I'm about to."
Logan Sargeant,remorse,0.3554,"I'm sorry, you're too old. You sure? You sure? Well, I'm just trying to want, so. Okay. Wait, wait. You're not going to get another lap, but like that. But okay, that's fine. Go cool. Why? You're not going to get another tool. That's why I mean. It was a good opportunity. But anyway, go cool. I'll feedback you on tires."
Lando Norris,neutral,0.8477,"And, Lando just a reminder, please do not use exit curve in tan 10."
Lando Norris,neutral,0.9494,"And feedback on the launch of target plus one timing is slightly late, target plus one."
Lando Norris,neutral,0.9614,"and suggestion right hand toggle for time 4, left hand toggle for time 6."
Pierre Gasly,admiration,0.7033,I'm up in to Q. 1-8 whistle and it will restart. Roger that. And a bit of start feedback. The drop was good and the drive out was a bit overdriven.
Pierre Gasly,neutral,0.9604,to copy that will have a look
Sergio Perez,annoyance,0.3636,What the mess is guys are creating come on come on we need to be better than this.
Fernando Alonso,joy,0.8805,"We are happy to have a good break, put some energy into the front."
Charles Leclerc,neutral,0.9333,"So compared to a sine theta 22.6, half a ten fastest sector 1 and half a ten the slower sector 2 and then faster again sector 3. So you have faster sector 1 and 3 slower sector 2, better to sine"
Charles Leclerc,neutral,0.6482,and we need a good exit turn 2 we see that you had a snap there
Lance Stroll,sadness,0.5562,Big problem. Completely lost car.
Lance Stroll,neutral,0.9331,"We're standing by, they're just checking if we can get the car fire, that we'll try and get you back to stand by. If we need to turn it off the temp, so I'll let you know. But standing by."
Lance Stroll,optimism,0.3784,a lance talent to stay away we're still going to try and fire this up
Lance Stroll,fear,0.6222,"OK, OK Lance, we believe we need to turn the car off and jump out. I'm afraid. So turn it off P0, must be P0, jump out, I'm sorry."
Yuki Tsunoda,desire,0.741,I want to change the helmet to the dark visor.
Yuki Tsunoda,neutral,0.7543,"We'll see her again, Lui sir. Just did it move away. Yes, so that coffee. It's okay, I'll disarm to him. That was the... was the... was the..."
Alexander Albon,approval,0.4982,"Okay, so I'll take a call at the time remaining, you can get away with a single, if so, plus 1515."
Alexander Albon,neutral,0.9421,So we're looking at eight time and up still the flag cap to Hamilton at three seconds.
Alexander Albon,neutral,0.9431,"We green in 30, keep it running, there will be 2 time before the flag 2 time."
Alexander Albon,neutral,0.9149,"So you will take the flag, you can push to exit 10. Push to exit 10."
Guanyu Zhou,neutral,0.7578,"They're all being too basmorphs. It's okay if I go fetch a battle. Pedal 1, pedal 1. The head of Paris might be I fuel."
Nico Hulkenberg,neutral,0.5663,"Let's slow, okay, and we want to try to avoid pull-fords, but we also want to try and do a start, so we'll send you out there now."
Nico Hulkenberg,approval,0.6908,"We're going to go back to the right changes. It feels worse than many places. So, we're going to go back to the right changes. Yeah, okay, understood. We'll get into that."
Nico Hulkenberg,approval,0.6323,"Okay, Nico, so you're in sync with a ton of cars on back-off laps and outlaps. So yes, there's a lot of cars ahead, so you should be able to do what you need and find a tow at the end of it."
Nico Hulkenberg,neutral,0.8873,Only lost to Kevin is turned for breaking your lap overall was 0.3 quicker.
Nico Hulkenberg,neutral,0.4794,"Current 6 was good, 3.5, Perez 4 behind Medium High Fuel."
Nico Hulkenberg,neutral,0.9462,"Starting last lap, build management needed."
Nico Hulkenberg,neutral,0.5575,"The last the previous started it was a clutch drop 2D because it was a very weird clutch drop with a lot of oscillation and vibration. Your clutch drop was okay, it's the stuff we're working on so just do the same clutch drop it'll be okay. So mode slow."
Esteban Ocon,optimism,0.9374,"Okay, so hopefully this for recovery isn't too long. We're going to keep the turn around or we're just going to sit ready to go basically."
Esteban Ocon,approval,0.5641,Tide temps are good so I'd say we can just treat this as a normal out lap no need for any additional energy.
Esteban Ocon,neutral,0.8383,"It's a bit of a mix of cars that improved on the second lap currently as our reference Pierre has not heated fast, low fast, we're slow on the second fast, I think he's going for another time now."
Esteban Ocon,approval,0.4865,"How's the balance please? A little bit of wind, train stability into 6 and some understand mid then. A little bit too much understand parabolic I11. Okay understood. Would you like to go for a second lap on this time? Yeah. Okay understood so we'll go for a double cool."
Esteban Ocon,approval,0.4717,"So you have recharge on currently we can go recharge off when you're ready. Yeah, but the bottom of the back guys so I went recharge and then go. Yeah, yeah, no, no, so I said recharge off when you're ready and push. Oh good."
Esteban Ocon,desire,0.6451,I'd like to cool the car tires as best we can please. Call the car tires as best we can on the way to the grid.
Ayumu Iwasa,approval,0.4593,"Okay Liam, there will be a big train behind you. You just focus on what you need to do for yourself. I will try to keep the position. There's very long cue coming behind. Position is good."
Ayumu Iwasa,admiration,0.8414,"Okay Liam, that's a good effort. It was very good sector 1 and 2. We were one ten-side in each sector. And, yeah, it's about turn 11. So we'll have a chance. Or we can do better then."
Ayumu Iwasa,approval,0.565,"Okay, Liam. So second push is a little bit irrelevant. Nobody improved on the tires can't take it on the first push. It was a ton eight. Men lost. So we'll have a look at this. Yeah, copy copy. Copy that. Yeah, I honestly, I just didn't have the really the big group increase that I was expecting. I was going to be had no toe with socks, but yeah, I had good traction on to you. I noticed a different sale, but entry of one. Yeah, I didn't mind."
Ayumu Iwasa,neutral,0.8033,"And Liam, that's seven minutes to check out flag seven minutes. So we get ready and we see if we can go out for a few laps."
Lewis Hamilton,neutral,0.8462,"Main lost to George, exit to turn two and also exit turn ten, maybe pushing entry to turn eight too much. Six tenths coming from the first sector, just two straights. It's mainly straight line but yeah there is a little bit of a lost turn one two. You got to be quick, change. There will cost us about 15 minutes of track time at least."
Lewis Hamilton,curiosity,0.4525,"How far am I down in the highest speed? Yeah, so it looks like we're about 5k down to George. So that's a bit more than Sim. Six tenths coming from the first sector. It's just two straights. It's mainly straight line, but yeah there is a little bit of a lost turn 1-2."
Lewis Hamilton,approval,0.5007,"I'd rather box and get this change and move just way out of bed. Yeah, I think that's it. Good wipe out to most of our programmers from release."
Lewis Hamilton,neutral,0.786,So we've got 20 seconds in hand to get those two laps.
Carlos Sainz,neutral,0.9528,"I'm more tailwind breaking turn 4, more tailwind breaking turn 4, or clear, can go."
Carlos Sainz,neutral,0.44,what are we looking to pull? go ahead
Carlos Sainz,neutral,0.9271,We are triggered for that and place to focus system 11. We can check together. Pit confirmation box will be stopped on the marks full crew.
Carlos Sainz,neutral,0.5738,"I think we start here to protect our here. The stood makes sense to us, 9 time laps on the board. And stay to free to stop. How many laps? 9 time laps, 9. And talk one with this engine. Talk one."
Carlos Sainz,gratitude,0.4792,"Okay, the jump today was tidy and happy birthday. Good luck, shit."
George Russell,desire,0.5428,At this time I can try to get one police for an extra one.
Oscar Piastri,neutral,0.9109,I can see something hanging from the rear. Brick duct it looks like on the left rear.
Oscar Piastri,neutral,0.9456,"These cars ahead just to open the flaps, pass behind or just finishing laps, that's science 12 seconds."
Oscar Piastri,admiration,0.8584,Yeah nice collide 2010
Oscar Piastri,joy,0.5593,"I'm happy to box there, so for high fuel. Copy, so we box the slap. That is B13. But as I said before, only yourself and Magnuson on hard other cars on medium, couple of soft runners. So Oscar from turn 728, you go Strat 5, no DRS, reach our job, Strat 5."
Oscar Piastri,approval,0.1637,"So Oscar, I'm keen to learn about these brakes where you have to, let's say, wrestle with other cars a bit. I'm happy to use DRS on these laps if you're closing up, and I'd prefer to learn a bit about the following and overtaking. You should get a few time laps. There is currently 30 seconds margin to that. Obviously there'll be some spread this lap."
Logan Sargeant,joy,0.849,I happy with the mechanical sensor you did. I happy to keep. Yes. Perfect.
Logan Sargeant,admiration,0.5474,"was a very good turn 1-2 in purple sector 1. I think there was a mistake 24-5. I'll give more feedback on the lap. Okay, I locked in the 4-5. Tap on add or come to 22-7-3-23-1. What am I targeting for zero? Pleasible."
Lando Norris,neutral,0.9554,"Opportunity, turn 7, focus mid-axid."
Lando Norris,annoyance,0.679,Why are people so stupid? We can't look in the mirrors there.
Pierre Gasly,neutral,0.7206,So we'll focus on the out-lap. We can do lift and turn three and then 123 through six and seven.
Pierre Gasly,neutral,0.9654,Sergeant is on a hard tire new hard. The little ruzzle is on new soft. Obviously Esteban on new hard and Hamilton on new soft.
Pierre Gasly,realization,0.6425,That works. I didn't know that calling may that too blame that meant I saw a button from. Copy that but I'll take a look.
Pierre Gasly,admiration,0.6304,And a bit of start feedback. The drop was good and the drive out was a big overtry.
Sergio Perez,neutral,0.4886,"How was turn 6-7? It was a little bit more loose. A little bit more loose. In which phase entry mid? Yeah, right at the apex."
Fernando Alonso,neutral,0.6041,"Okay, so we'll let them do the way to X."
Fernando Alonso,neutral,0.5885,So from outside the ride is looking and the oscillation is looking a bit better in 8. It might be worth trying to curve there if you think that's sensible.
Fernando Alonso,neutral,0.955,
Fernando Alonso,neutral,0.5882,"The car's behind us slow. Yeah, everyone is blown, they will have a lots of price on qualifying. Yeah, copy me, yep."
Fernando Alonso,neutral,0.8915,"So it's Sergeant 11 second back, faster than sight's 20 seconds back. We'll all fuel all high too. Everyone low fuel, all low fuel."
Charles Leclerc,approval,0.6477,"So, losing one tenth turn one, we need better peak. Yeah, good thing I used to do this card, but it feels better. Copy. And do not push entry turn six. Losing half a tenth. And then... What is the main log? It's at night 10 now. Yeah, that's correct. We saw that you had traffic over there. Next card behind pushing, hook, 13 seconds. So, if you agree, we go for double cooldown lap. Yeah."
Charles Leclerc,neutral,0.9696,Round 10 to 15 seconds max.
Lance Stroll,neutral,0.9171,clean these tyres up get them up to temperature
Lance Stroll,neutral,0.9502,5 seconds to the outstreet. If we want a toe we can drop behind the outstreet and the other 3 behind the outstreet.
Lance Stroll,neutral,0.4061,You're really looking a bit better so we need to work on the brakes.
Lance Stroll,admiration,0.5467,"So we're good. So Lance target for us is no tow, next town, no tow. So for now there's going to come through sites now. Start working on brakes. Start working on brakes. Don't lean on the rear left, 6 and 7 and a bit of full load out of 7 for the peer."
Kevin Magnussen,disapproval,0.8786,"So we're, we suggest using the right hand toggle, the turn 11 entry stability, possibly also 6, 7. Yeah, I don't agree, guys."
Yuki Tsunoda,anger,0.7197,What the fuck is size 2 in other states?
Yuki Tsunoda,curiosity,0.5142,"I feel like the tire was already ready and I turned one to two. I feel like two-cold down is over to okay, how do you think?"
Yuki Tsunoda,neutral,0.9367,You can let's go for one single cooldown and that double later.
Alexander Albon,neutral,0.955,
Guanyu Zhou,neutral,0.7522,"Let me know if the brake is ready, it's pretty poor. The brake rolling goes good and we box is left, box box, practice speed entry."
Guanyu Zhou,neutral,0.944,You're talking in the middle of the corners.

Esteban Ocon,neutral,0.4715,"Okay, when you're to rev out the top please change. If we do an arrow cruise after 10 please, arrow P45 here, next car back is Leclerc, high fuel, 9 seconds. When I arrive to the corner, I do the front potential on the second lap each time. Okay, how about the first lap? The second lap is okay, the second lap. Okay."
Esteban Ocon,approval,0.3466,"So nice and steady for the end of the lap again. Tired temperatures are on target now. I do, we don't want them any hotter and it will still be for burnouts please. Quite a drop from the end. The pit lane was a little bit light, about 3%. So we can target a tiny bit deeper for the grid start. It was a strange start when I built the rails on that one. Okay, I understand, we'll have a look at that one. Let's see what we get on the grid as well. Nothing to be concerned about at the moment. So for burnouts please start on the left hand side and we are going to push to turn 11 after the start."
Ayumu Iwasa,admiration,0.6572,"Okay, good info, Liam. I think we could have taken a little bit more flop. So we'll nail it for quality playing. And we'll show you the few places where we can find a little bit of fun. That was a good, a good lap. Yeah, copy."

Ayumu Iwasa,curiosity,0.4034,"I had a lot of understeer in the 6th and 7th. I'm guessing because of the cars in France. But yeah, we need to investigate that quickly. Could you be able to overshoot half a step on the first set? We see if we have to roll back on the second set. We try a bit more than plans for the balance. Yeah, to be honest, yes. I would like to do that. Or is it because we should have a step-up as well? Copy, it's time-by."
Ayumu Iwasa,neutral,0.6752,"Okay, there. So we don't need as much space on this components. Keep looking at your dash for the timings. Important bit again is to have enough gap for turn 11."

So, formation lap procedures, 012, the dominant and formation lap, pit limiter off, and a static 5.5 at once, the car is on the ground. Carry out your launch to third gear, and then do the formation lap, looking for, ground plus 15 on your rear left, plus 15 on your rear left, target, if you feel should be possible to achieve it. Now lift the coast into turn 11, and no more than 50% throttle from there. From side and script position, which is grid slot 15, another reminder, arbitrary pit wall is speed 14. One lock, one short, and an extra rampant rather closer down with your sub position."
Max Verstappen,neutral,0.8217,"Okay Max, we're expecting that you race start to be aborted so expecting you to switch your engine off and be at a 5 minute delay."

Yeah I know but I can't save that much because how much is catching a lot, he's a little quick with this point so I'm trying to pick up the pace."

But a big support compared to Spa, so I think we did a good job this weekend Lord and everyone. Exactly, good job this weekend. Very good race today on your side as well. And I think you're struck to the most of the car today. I think Al-Wan Watch has a little bit too fast on the stretch for us."

Okay, radio radio is still quite poor. Did you say scenario one, talk six? Thank you. Okay. On the other hand, anything better? I can do on a commercial app or call good. So suggest more weaving.

Pierre Gasly,neutral,0.933,So we think Holkamburg ahead is starting to struggle with the fronts and Bottas is the car behind 1.7 second gap and he is on used mediums
Pierre Gasly,desire,0.265,painful one very painful but it's okay we'll understand and just really want us to understand why we're so slow and uh and we'll fight back but uh we gotta understand most important how to try with the strategy so no regrets now we move on from this weekend and we'll come back so I can sing a poem go fight for the points yeah we had to try something it was a tough one out there but well driven and we'll look forwarded from here

Fernando Alonso,neutral,0.8732,So maximum temperature when you can on the tyres and then good lifts then a good break
Fernando Alonso,neutral,0.9138,"It's a real tight temp still raising. I think another click forwards, break bounce if you can, another click forwards, break bounce."

We're after this quality wanted to nail, we did that this weekend. That's ticked. And this was a tough one, but it's kind of thing we need to learn as well to do and to manage.

Max Verstappen,admiration,0.6617,"That was a fun nice shot. Yeah, good, very sad. I think we executed that well. Much better than last year. Yeah, well, our max has a great start to the weekend. Well done. A lot of good information there."
Max Verstappen,approval,0.3671,"I think you managed that well, Max. I looked after the tyres in the right places, the right time. Obviously still have plenty to go. 14-7 on the last lap is very strong. Let's say Norris gave up the Ghost, Czecho 15-5 last lap, Russell 16-9. That was their pace at the end, Leclerc 16-5.

Lando Norris,neutral,0.5309,"What line is he doing at the last corner? Is he like wide or cutting the apex? I'll come back to you. Yeah, I should have had it already, you know. Just look at one corner. Copy. Land off. He's not taking much care. He's just a bit better out of the corner on throttle."

A lot of luck at tonight. Try and find that pace. Yeah, can't be that. What was the pace of Max's landing at the end? Max at the end was doing 14-8-14-7. 14-8. Norris was doing 15-3-15-4. Wow is it?

Daniel Ricciardo,neutral,0.3831,"Okay, so I think you definitely feel a bit more fun limited. Only time I'm really fighting the rear is with ride. And that upsets the rear grip. Samsung 4B and pushing, that is. Okay, so I'm not coming now on which cornering particular place box box."

Kevin Magnussen,neutral,0.6926,"Okay, Kev, that's the checkered flag. That's the checkered flag, so that's over. For reference, you finished P16, Ricardo behind Dupes 17, Alonzo Piestri and Ocob all retired."
Yuki Tsunoda,neutral,0.526,"Okay we call the car and we stop on the grid. Call the car, stop on the grid. It's more like a stability side I would say. High speed is good stability. Probably stop more towards the wall. We call it like 14. It starts to get a bit of the same corner, but we can probably adjust the speed as which is the interaction is not the best. So, we have to move on similar one here at least."
Yuki Tsunoda,neutral,0.9653,perm控 sentence on the
Yuki Tsunoda,neutral,0.9527,"Update on tires in balance, please. Copy."
Yuki Tsunoda,neutral,0.5169,"You can run up and get your job together, then you don't go to work on a car but it's okay, still it pays, okay."

Alexander Albon,neutral,0.4128,"Oh, it just happened there in the corner. Okay, we're checking."
Alexander Albon,approval,0.3013,Yeah and now we've had a track limit to turn 19 last lap. Okay so we need to create a gap to Hulkenberg. Yeah okay okay. What's the face difference? Alex we're lacking four tenths quicker than Hulkenberg so we're all good. Gap seven seconds and he's fighting with Logan as well so that's slowing him down.

I was surprised how bad the hard was, but I think everyone was right on the hard snow. Yeah, our pace was pretty good on that hard, but yeah, we'll have a look and review after the race. It feels a good job for me, or side? Yeah, but our pace was relatively good, or it was actually good on the hards. Probably we would just clear out traffic on the hard tire and then we'd destroyed the tires. I don't really know if you guys expected me to overtake Joe in that stint, but I was just, I was like a killer stint. Yeah, so on that hard, it pace was a bit worse than yesterday, but compared to others, it was competitive. So we will review it all, see what we can prove next time. And when you can, the should be the last one, blue, ten, position 13, please, blue, ten, thirteen."

Nico Hulkenberg,confusion,0.9027,"I don't understand why we know the time problem he sent me out right to push. Yeah, I just didn't go understood. Yeah, understood is too late."
Nico Hulkenberg,neutral,0.845,"Ok, Niko, you finished P13, you were within 10 seconds of Albon, so he should have a penalty, so that will be P12. Sonoto was P10, he was like 10 seconds up the road, but he did an extra stop to get fast to slap the end."
Esteban Ocon,approval,0.4116,"So everything in terms of balance is as we talked about. I think let's see how we get on with that tailwind into 19. We've got the Model 5 for there as we talked about the Stuart, so that's all good. No change to any of the procedures on the formation map. So I think we'll just be pinning through all ones to cast fire up for this model."
Esteban Ocon,neutral,0.7252,"Ok, let's go up, up, up, up speed, think we've got damage left and side pod about 40 points of load at the moment."

I really appreciate you not giving up on us. No, never give up mate. Never give up. That's a solid drive."
Lewis Hamilton,admiration,0.9533,"Lo is really done. We could have done a few things better, but your driving was great and nice to see that we did a real fast. The pace of the car was there, and to win it, your driving was amazing. Concert relationship."

Just left by the upgating lots of grip so not any easy sessions to really rate the balance of the car. Yeah it is gusty like every lap is slightly different in a few corners. Basically on the main straight we have the headwind and then almost all the corners is tell or crosswind so not easy but that's the same for everybody. I like it, it's a good track, it's nice flow but it still needs to grip up a bit more to be more incredible."
Oscar Piastri,admiration,0.9423,Cover the front left looks quite badly great.

Valtteri Bottas,neutral,0.8659,So far we see the truck about a half a second slower than FP2.
Valtteri Bottas,neutral,0.9175,So we need to do a full switch off then please Veltery.
Oscar Piastri,neutral,0.9042,This is a pit stop for the medium. Pull away. I still feel it now launch. Keep the launch map off.
Oscar Piastri,approval,0.6409,"Yeah, turn cool. It's the biggest issue with balance."
Oscar Piastri,caring,0.8968,take care through that's P2 we're boxed this lap track slippery turn 3-4

Logan Sargeant,joy,0.8639,"To be honest guys, I think that's all we had in the weekend. I'm really happy with that lap and that's all I had for you today so if it ain't enough, that ain't enough."
Daniel Ricciardo,remorse,0.6783,"Yeah, traffic, I'm sorry. Comit traffic. Comit traffic. Comit traffic."
Daniel Ricciardo,neutral,0.5448,I really struggle to get the tyres there. I'm first push.
Lando Norris,remorse,0.7617,"Yeah, okay, that's just screwed over by science a bit, but nothing we could have done really about that, so... Good effort. No, I'm sorry, I could have found a better position."
Pierre Gasly,neutral,0.7345,"Alright, so we are P5."
Pierre Gasly,admiration,0.4747,"Did some good laps today, shame about that at the end. Real good sector 2. Yeah that's a shame. Still a first few three guys. So it's good to be in there, good job. Good to be here and we'll race from here tomorrow."

Charles Leclerc,annoyance,0.4835,This is the worst position that we are to face with everybody.
Charles Leclerc,neutral,0.9497,Something moving in the pedals.
Alexander Albon,neutral,0.9679,It dumpling
Alexander Albon,admiration,0.8447,"Good work Alex, I always see you come back on your lap though, you've broken the 1 on 11, it's good. Good solid lap for Superc, you're gonna see what? Yeah, I wonder everyone, I think we made a hard work, I wanna strike our best track so far this year. So have it lightly enjoyed it, huh?"
Esteban Ocon,caring,0.3163,I'm still okay.
Carlos Sainz,neutral,0.8924,"finding a preparation for a final comprehensive tool, the Fun Щ°T visual spanning the leading points from the join"

George Russell,gratitude,0.9889,"Yeah, thanks everybody for all my hard work this weekend and I've all been acting in factory. I've pushed these upgrades through, definitely making progress. It's really good, so let's keep on building. Thank you."
Max Verstappen,confusion,0.3468,I'm entirely sure why Russell's going so slowly. He's just giving them a free pit stop gap eventually. Keep it there for the moment.
Max Verstappen,neutral,0.9606,that
Max Verstappen,neutral,0.4583,I had to go to the toilet from that point. I was probably the hardest thing of the race.
Logan Sargeant,remorse,0.6632,"I know what we're trying to do, but a bit of a disaster, to be honest. It was a good move on Joe. Sorry, we didn't work out today and what we're doing strategically, but lots to learn from and move on from here."
Lando Norris,neutral,0.955,
Lando Norris,caring,0.5546,Everyone okay? Everyone's okay. Quite a few cars out.
Lando Norris,neutral,0.9446,"The entire information and the veraries on the hard, we think the Mercedes bestapet are on the video."
Lando Norris,neutral,0.5146,"a little bit of abrasion, I see the front lift. Okay, I know. We see it. It's the same level as Ferrari had about 10 laps ago."
Lando Norris,neutral,0.9584,"And then we see the first signs of front left graining on sites, just abrasion for you."
Lando Norris,admiration,0.8152,"How's my front left looking compared to them? I can under the 4 of you, you are the best."
Lando Norris,neutral,0.8542,"And I know something starting to think about, if there was a safe to go we'd have a free stop, we think we'd take it from medium, Carlos would need us to stay out or take a soft, have a think. I mean a free stop, I'd definitely take of course."
Lando Norris,admiration,0.7912,Man that was so fun. Wow beautiful. Congrats Oscar on the podium. I wasn't team second or fourth is not bad at all so congrats. We did what we could.
Pierre Gasly,curiosity,0.3641,What did you do? What did he try to attack? Red flag. But the old car is damaged now.
Pierre Gasly,admiration,0.7945,"It was a long old race but very good job managing those tires and managing the gaps. Good work today. Thank you guys. I will say positive we came with the first free of the year and I think we did the best we could. Let's keep pushing. It's just a point but going in the right direction. Let's keep pushing guys. We'll keep pushing, taking steps forward."
Fernando Alonso,neutral,0.63,The steering is heavier than yesterday. A lot heavier just check that it's all good for you.
Fernando Alonso,disapproval,0.6258,"I thought we would pretend, mate. No, trade not."
Charles Leclerc,neutral,0.3472,He's everybody okay? Everybody is fine. Carlos had a puncture.
Charles Leclerc,confusion,0.5976,If you can we need to slow down a bit. What is this scope of that? We are preventing McLaren to have a pit stop window because we have no Russian. This happening? I didn't get it. That makes me push it to slow speed which I don't like.
Charles Leclerc,remorse,0.5797,just for you ain't for I think you have around I mean do you want to know the margin? no Charles we're not interested we know he said alright no we are not interested that's rude sorry
Charles Leclerc,gratitude,0.9855,"Oh, just bring it home. Thank you."
Charles Leclerc,joy,0.5247,We won it finally
Charles Leclerc,optimism,0.8573,"I need to call down myself as well. Yeah, don't worry. We'll think about that later with some champagne. Tonight is going to be a big night. I think no one's going back home. I didn't understand that. We all stay here. You better stay. I hope Trimmy's is ready."
Lance Stroll,remorse,0.5397,"So just a cover list. Sorry about that. It's okay, mate. No right. We were put here. We were constantly. So that's very dumb. There's nothing else on the table. So it's worth a go, isn't it?"
Yuki Tsunoda,approval,0.5789,"Ok, you have a marginal strategy so you can push more now. That's what I tell ya."
Yuki Tsunoda,gratitude,0.9025,"We are done with the sandbags. Clean the race week was nice. And physically that was a pretty easy race. Thank you very much. But yeah, enjoyed the last couple of laps. I'm all done. Thank you."
Alexander Albon,admiration,0.7181,"Lovely stuff, P9. Yeah, yeah, well done. Not sure what. Right, so that was, but the hard boat was done yesterday, well done. Well deserved. Yeah, he was too slow to face. My, my, my, my tires just fell out the window and I couldn't ever get them. Never get them back up from true."
Nico Hulkenberg,caring,0.5996,"Are you okay, Nico? Damn it! That was unnecessary. Yeah."
Lewis Hamilton,caring,0.3741,"Red flag, red flag, keep Delta positive. Staying in the past."

Lewis Hamilton,admiration,0.885,"So yeah, P7. I've done so that's so we didn't get more points today but it's a really great effort. I'm taking one back home for bringing the upgrades. These past few weeks really appreciate the hard work. Keep it up. Ready guys."
Carlos Sainz,neutral,0.9555,"Chase, add more"
Carlos Sainz,confusion,0.2954,"There is a risk that if we open 20 seconds, it will not go so far. Maybe? Yep, we are on this. I think a lot of soft could be dangerous. A different race. Tires are starting to rain for everyone."
Carlos Sainz,neutral,0.4431,"Allandos between the Isbeain Verstappen or Info? Yeah, but it may post it if he suddenly gets up in an hour window. Yep, sure. We can not allow that."
Carlos Sainz,neutral,0.9698,youchange

George Russell,disgust,0.6643,Right feels a little bit worse today.
George Russell,neutral,0.9297,George Knowney to stick this close to Norris. Just manage these tyres at this stage. This is the only opportunity.
George Russell,caring,0.7344,"Don't be nervous you want me to manage everywhere or just 3, 4, 5. If I continue this pace we're going to open a pit stop for them."
George Russell,neutral,0.7108,"I recommend about three seconds in the pocket here. Just two to the round currently. So George at this stage, we gain nothing from driving faster. Hey fam."
George Russell,gratitude,0.7628,"Good job there mate, mod up P5. Yeah thanks guys. Shave him a lot of number star, I think we had a road challenge today on the offset strategy but good points, card feeling great and thanks for the hard work bringing these upgrades. Dodge, you will be surprised to hear very very very good well driven, no surprise I guess. The surprise is the compliment from you. We're complimented to you."
Valtteri Bottas,neutral,0.9466,It will be a standing start.
Valtteri Bottas,disappointment,0.5512,"Yeah, it's a shame we couldn't race more, but we showed good pace whenever we had the opportunity. Yeah, that was tough one, just impossible to get by some of the cars. But yeah, try it. Try the best I could. We got one nice little Monaco overtake."
Oscar Piastri,remorse,0.775,Sorry for all the wounds.
Oscar Piastri,caring,0.4426,"Check the floor on the right side. Yeah, some contact. Is everyone okay in the cash? I believe everyone is okay."
Oscar Piastri,approval,0.5359,"Oscar, we do see the impact of the damage and it looks like the aerobalance is sensible at least."
Oscar Piastri,neutral,0.6662,"I feel like that's starting from Ferrari to try and catch us out with Carlos. Because I don't really get why they'd want to keep Russell in the window. The medium of science was damaged on lap 1, so he does not have a medium only this hard and some softs. We think they want to avoid Lando trying anything."
Oscar Piastri,neutral,0.3702,"Doesn't really seem to be slowing down. It must be worried about something. Well, that was I could just be slowing down."
Oscar Piastri,gratitude,0.991,"P2, lovely job. P2 and Monaco, I'll take it. Thanks everyone. Yeah, thanks everyone. Nice to get on the podium. Thank you. Clearly still something still work on."

Daniel Ricciardo,approval,0.805,"Okay, I'll give feedback in a second. Yeah, oh good."
Daniel Ricciardo,neutral,0.8202,"And then you'll take no risk, we try to learn for a drying truck in quality. Take the one a bit down back to the trees and then not too bad. We have signs to turn one pushing on the clear truck."
Daniel Ricciardo,neutral,0.927,Lecler first push was 4 second off compared to Inter but Rackle kept increasing.
Pierre Gasly,joy,0.444,"And as discussed, let's get a feel for the track. We're happy to do a time lap, but no need to do too many. We're going to avoid damaging the tires as possible."
Pierre Gasly,admiration,0.54,"Okay, Pierre, that love's good for P2. How's the track? It's good, yeah."
Pierre Gasly,joy,0.7489,Ok so let's try and avoid to damage these so happy to complete this lap and then box.

Valtteri Bottas,joy,0.7168,"Yeah, not so many laps, obviously. And yeah, quite compromised conditions. Every run was different grip level, different patches of dry and wet track. So not easy to learn much, but at least we got initial idea of the balance. Yeah, part of the game happens when you try. So I'm going to find the way we see them. It's pretty technical track. I mean, yeah, the chicane and stuff. It needs a lot of precision. You're going all the curves close to walls. It's enjoyable. And yeah, but let's hope for with no sun is often it. It's very smooth. Oh, actually, it's super smooth track. So yeah, it changes a bit. The setup philosophy for sure from the past. But yeah, I can grip this also."

Pierre Gasly,neutral,0.5976,"Alright, so for the start we'd like to do on the left hand side again. We'll do three burnouts this time out of turn 14. Then we'd like a static bind point learned on the grid and a second gear start."
Fernando Alonso,neutral,0.948,So everyone is on soft other than psychs is on medium.
Fernando Alonso,confusion,0.7705,"Is it too wet banana? I mean, it's really good. I don't know, man. It's so difficult to guess. It's very bad, you know. But one love, maybe, okay, I don't know. It's the most temperature you can in and we'll have a look."

Esteban Ocon,neutral,0.6492,"Okay, the range looking sporadic could be anything from two to five minutes from now. We recharge the one scenario 7 up that might be our best chance."
Esteban Ocon,curiosity,0.5481,"So, what's the clear 4 seconds one? Do we have a choice obviously now is right? So it's gonna go quicker until then. Yep, understood. What do we do now? So up to you. Okay, so standby for my prepare to do another lap and I'll get back to you. We have to gauge it about what we're learning here as well.

George Russell,neutral,0.681,"Yeah, just a minute. We're quite keen to make an adjust in the pits. Got a science 10 second was behind. I mean, this dry line is appearing now, so it's, um, we're going to be damaging the tire currently. I'm not letting you do my bomb. Yeah, copy that."
George Russell,neutral,0.7198,Let me know what you want on tyres compared to current. We think minus 5 is more realistic for where you'd be on this tyre.
Valtteri Bottas,approval,0.4695,"What's happening with the rear brakes? They are super hot. Yep, we see that. Let's go forward on brake balance, plus four. Bit more right here now. Understood. Let's box this lap. Box, Veltary, box. Go, box."

Let's get the auntie on my weekend, please. Oh, my God, man. We can do a double chord, but we're going to retire on time. I think we're going to have a change in the garage. I'm going to the toilet, so I think we're going to retire. No, it's OK. Let's just turn box. I honestly don't really need the four-inch legbell.

Max Verstappen,neutral,0.8599,"Max, we've got a circuit update from the safety car. We have some standing water at the apex of turn two, but the remainder of the track is simply wet. No puddles.

Lando Norris,neutral,0.7054,"And I know two things. One opportunity. Turn three, four. Your losses to other people is when you push the entry too much. And next one. Start thinking about dry tyre. How far away on which one? Yeah, I mean the tyre diminute. You'd always want to choose a song. But it's like this is better as a slick media, I think, for quite a long time.

Nico Hulkenberg,neutral,0.8918,It feels like the rear is maybe overheating a bit.
Nico Hulkenberg,neutral,0.8012,"Kevin's boxing now. Yes, enters because he has a gap. I think it's that way we should try and hang it out to the slicks. But it's in a long way. Copy that, we'll keep talking about it. So the gap behind is still five."

Yeah, you're wrong. What I'll say is we came 10 and we started right at the back with very little hope we're getting anything out of this. And most of that is down to the fact that you drove very well and kept a cool head through difficult conditions. So you should be very pleased with yourself and I'm kind of thank you for that as well. Thank you. We're happy to have been working with you guys two days. And Josh, very happy.

George Russell,neutral,0.7464,"There's nothing one and two is dry. But if you're going to rain, let's put it in a box and put a wet foot in a rain cup. Yeah, copy that George understand, but do not wish to fit a new inter on this dry track. That both of course."
George Russell,neutral,0.9279,Let me know in Norris time five as if he's managing or if he was doing it in time sip one To the end of the rain yeah a firm for now
George Russell,neutral,0.8931,"This is going to be time one and two again. Still very wet, ever road to dry. Yeah, a firm."
George Russell,neutral,0.942,"So just keeping on those case intents, I've seen you driving. The rain already, I've seen you driving offline. This is going to be time one and two again. Still very wet, ever road to dry."
George Russell,disappointment,0.4937,I lost a lot of time from Norris for voiding action one hour seconds.

Oscar Piastri,neutral,0.4223,"I'll see you in the next video. Oscar with Boxing this lap. Which time would you like? Copy box. I think it is, I think it's getting better now. Copy, so we'll drive straight out again. Copy. Oscar Pellet."
Oscar Piastri,neutral,0.7732,"Oscar, this range should continue now. It could get up to class 2 or 3 in about 5 minutes this time and should stop around quarter past 2."
Oscar Piastri,neutral,0.9632,a
Oscar Piastri,desire,0.5478,Okay purple last lap was for staff and 293 your pace is good it's all about consistency now some guidelines started forming high speed sections understood oscar understood Alonzo is 10 seconds behind so you've got some breathing room here we just want good pace on this tire for the moment oscar we need to pick the point where we would pick the slick if there was a safety bell yep it's the way to what the moment
Oscar Piastri,neutral,0.7499,"We expect rain, lap 33 to lap 35, at most 10 minutes, class 2."
Oscar Piastri,neutral,0.9686,"Target, rear, 80 degrees all lower, 80 degrees all lower on rear."
Oscar Piastri,optimism,0.4986,Oscar we still think to avoid hitting before the rain would the track cope with a slick now? I don't think it'll be quicker with a slick but I think it will cope.
Oscar Piastri,neutral,0.955,
Oscar Piastri,neutral,0.954,"Grace Pinture update, Hamilton and Alonzo are 15 seconds behind and other cars are 25 seconds behind"
Oscar Piastri,neutral,0.9596,"and recharge off to help with temperature. Cars behind have stopped as well, Hamilton and Alonzo. Car behind is now Hamilton. And all these cars on Inter Oscar, expecting more rain."
Oscar Piastri,neutral,0.8373,I think if the rain doesn't get heavier and there's a big gap behind where I only lose let's say less than five positions I would take a take a slick copy For the Stairborne's bunched up now for their resalt uskin We'll keep an eye on LeClack who has gone onto a hard
Oscar Piastri,neutral,0.8809,Turn six and seven rain has stopped. start with the foot across. Can we turn out for this day ofーい 1. Gall stay in that bay of
Oscar Piastri,curiosity,0.6708,How's the train? Getting very dry now. And would your preference be medium or hard? 42 vary you..
Oscar Piastri,neutral,0.8809,You can use overtake to be close with the staff in a rustle and that looks it.
Oscar Piastri,curiosity,0.5907,"I just go request the whole position. Do you think you could challenge the staff and you as 17 fall, Asla? Man, I need to open some cubic rustle behind and just leave it to it."
Max Verstappen,neutral,0.9668,Our correspondents alan
Logan Sargeant,approval,0.6197,"Ok, I log and try to bleed a little bit. That's fine, ok, I'm building 3 after turn 9, building 3."
Daniel Ricciardo,approval,0.523,"Okay, we have no one pushing behind. Let's focus on this cooldown. Position is good."
Daniel Ricciardo,neutral,0.7059,Ok then we can consider one more lap on this tire on reduce the number of lap on the next tire. It looks like it's gonna be a single push.
Daniel Ricciardo,neutral,0.6469,"Ok, let's try to have a bit of a way down that flop, but if you still feel this limitation, we can do the push to go up on 4. So compared to Yuki, he's Ving the corner more in turn 1 still, but what we did in the previous step was better."
Daniel Ricciardo,admiration,0.8554,"Good biking, turn 10 please, super important."
Lando Norris,disappointment,0.6116,"There's instability into nice corners, pretty poor grip from the rear. As soon as I have that traits stability into the whole corners, pretty much gone."
Lando Norris,joy,0.659,"I'm probably happy to box and I think unless people are going quick, I'll go back. Okay, Lando Witchcase will box this lap for the hard time."
Lando Norris,neutral,0.7606,It was a bit shaky.
Pierre Gasly,neutral,0.5761,"Okay, we'll go recharge on. We charge on that's P15."
Pierre Gasly,neutral,0.5996,"Okay, there's a recharge on our preference for the tires is double cool. Now lap is P10 at the minute. Yeah, just out I need to know the gap out of me. I started with the I don't know. Okay, copy that."
Pierre Gasly,disappointment,0.3649,"I think something wrong with the box, the camera is drivable."
Sergio Perez,curiosity,0.7241,"Is there anything wrong with the front of pedal that we are on the steering too much? What do I know next? Next, we'll have a talk in the car."
Sergio Perez,neutral,0.8723,And then push toggle is available if you need it turn 4. I'll see you next step.
Fernando Alonso,neutral,0.9619,There's two minutes 20C content in the engine off when you get down there.
Fernando Alonso,approval,0.6449,"The track is clear, but it's also clear. You can push on the car just to drive the flowers, but just steady through three."
Fernando Alonso,neutral,0.9489,"The exit curve in turn 9, we were something flying out of the front winds better to check."
Fernando Alonso,joy,0.4322,"I'm just looking if we do a single call and get into consecutive we'll get four maybe five in a row. Yeah, yeah, single call. Yeah, copy. Just going to see the locking up the switch is a bit for the high fuel of the consecutive consecutive. Pursuit pushing three behind followed by the staff and we'll go to strats seven when you can. Pursuit number seven is any two behind him. So the staff is close and then you've got a bit of gap. So clear a gap is 20 seconds back so I'm happy to let a load of cars through on this one and we can get to the back of this train. But they will slow down in the last corner man so I'm happy here I think. Yeah, okay, yeah. So you've got four seconds back to the cars behind. So the permanent is two behind pushing there's three and then there's a four second gap. Yeah, okay, you'll burn me. Whatever you want. Let the three behind and we'll use that four second gap back to magazine."
Charles Leclerc,neutral,0.5812,"Let me know if we are boxing or you are doing another push. Oh no, I am doing another push. Copy."
Charles Leclerc,neutral,0.9031,"The guy is throwing this for now. Okay, we're having a look."
Charles Leclerc,neutral,0.8893,The bed lane is closed and it should be green now.
Charles Leclerc,neutral,0.9393,and we suggest to launch the lap easier 13 and maximum speed and 14.
Charles Leclerc,neutral,0.8475,"Wind phase 9, slightly smaller rotation from 10 and you can open the gupp as much as you need, not sure the fuel level of the cars around you."
Charles Leclerc,joy,0.5252,"Go easy, I'll start partying. Around you, a bit for stroll. I'll just hit the middle of the corner as always."
Charles Leclerc,neutral,0.7555,There was something strange with the clutch when I came in. I kept the clutch and the real tyres locked up completely and then went again when I was stopping for the box now. Copy.
Lance Stroll,admiration,0.7439,"So this position is good, stay ahead of sergeant if we can, he might be on the way in and it would just be go on after turn 13."
Lance Stroll,optimism,0.549,"Okay, that's a different timing. I think we can aim to get this lap done. The fence is coming down quite nicely, so it will be go one after turn 13."
Kevin Magnussen,approval,0.606,"Okay, Kev, I think we're going to have to go to the heavy fuel load now because if we do another run on low fuel we're not going to have any time for heavy fuel laps at all. Yeah, okay. So boxing this lap. Boxbox."
Kevin Magnussen,neutral,0.779,"Ok, please use DRS on the next lap."

Esteban Ocon,neutral,0.5299,"Okay, so caught. A bit, a lane speed limiter is not very smooth, it's pushing and going back. Understood, clip it, exit."
Esteban Ocon,approval,0.5308,"OK, so first question is balanced. Do we need to do a flak adjust? I don't think so, no, I think that was OK. OK, there's a small amount of balancing in Berlin 9. Yeah, the front end was better. OK, that's good. Ricardo, three and a half now, time blap. Looks like most cars on these softer two compounds are considering double calls at the moment."
Esteban Ocon,neutral,0.8667,Just going into first timed just how we look at what we can do for REM structure.
Esteban Ocon,approval,0.7186,"Yeah, grip, drop-pressively, that lap. Yeah, understood. Let's see what we get after a double-cool, see if anything comes back. Yeah, then 3.4 became loose. Turn 9, 4-shot, understood. Understood."
Esteban Ocon,approval,0.7392,"Okay, so recharge on watch for science sustainable. I keep pushing I think. Okay. If that's okay with you. Yeah, I understand my old lady knows it's not. Yeah, copy. The base goes slow. See good. Copy."

Ryo Hirakawa,neutral,0.8877,So you can go into mode RS to leave the box to a practice start from the box and remember we are adding arrow balance.
Ryo Hirakawa,neutral,0.7379,"Okay, checkered flag, checkered flag will go around for the practice start."
Ryo Hirakawa,approval,0.7524,"So we stay out and do a practice start. That's correct, we're going around to the grid so you can go into mode slow, we'll do a start on the left hand side. One burnout, one burnout. Make sure it's clear ahead the box ahead before you do your start. So mode slow, one burnout, left hand side and mode RS for the start."
Ryo Hirakawa,gratitude,0.979,"Thank you. Good job. Thanks a lot. Yeah, just a bit messy. The long run I did a mistake in the 10-4, I guess you saw it after that. It was a good love to get back the real temperature. So very interesting. But no, thank you very much. It was a nice out there. Cool. Good job. You can jump out. Copy."
Carlos Sainz,neutral,0.5103,And the wind is as expected.

Carlos Sainz,neutral,0.6692,"Yeah, maybe the button is going up a bit towards up the studio. Okay, I'll just open it a little bit."
Carlos Sainz,neutral,0.9466,"This is tire position 2 for the arm tire position 2. For the medium sorry tire position 2 for the medium. Apparently going out, no stretch, no stability."
George Russell,joy,0.8587,I'm happy to do a cruise across the line on the first lap of the green finish on the
George Russell,neutral,0.7324,I don't want to know who it was and they are pulled to the right and he just aimed for me.
George Russell,curiosity,0.7388,Just let me know if you need any flap adjust in the box. How is the pace? The main loss looks to be speed into turn or one.
George Russell,admiration,0.6666,Why be put it on track with the next endpoint? It's a good question.
Valtteri Bottas,approval,0.5873,"I'm not sure if you're going to be able to get the right to the right. Would you like to try a flop of just? I can try just the tires. I'm going away, so it's actually pretty pointless. It's going around here. Okay. Yeah, understood."
Oscar Piastri,neutral,0.6629,"So that's P8, how's the flat? Flaps have been hard to judge, so 9 who's quite understeer even, ever else it's no"
Oscar Piastri,neutral,0.6677,"Okay, Oscar, we've come up 10 turns for an arrow test. We've come up 10 turns for an arrow test."
Max Verstappen,neutral,0.4943,"Okay, health balance, please Max. Oh, of course, Minnes. The exits. Still, we'd understand, in corners. It's got us in bite. On a sip."
Max Verstappen,neutral,0.8728,"OK, well boxes, let's please, Max. Max, let me say the other way."
Max Verstappen,neutral,0.9568,So Max heads up looking at 11 time lapse on the medium and we can pit stop for four further laps at the end for the soft 11 and 4.
Logan Sargeant,admiration,0.6333,"Okay, Logan, good job on the warm up before target minus 10, we copy what we've done before."
Logan Sargeant,curiosity,0.4987,"Do you need any clapper just? Flap is good. Okay, copy."
Logan Sargeant,neutral,0.6562,"Okay, look at the flap, it didn't go in, so we have the same flap as before. Let me know about the balance, we can change it, let me know it is the car now. I'm a bit on the other side. Okay, copy, we're gonna do it. Let's see how the volks... Okay, copy, we have time for a stop later, let's see how we are."
Logan Sargeant,admiration,0.8668,"Ok, Logan, good job, 3 laps to go, lap time target 21.5, you are ok with tires, good job, turn 4, lateral we can save a bit more if needed."
Lando Norris,approval,0.8085,"Oh yeah, hit the floor for the heart. Okay, understood."
Pierre Gasly,neutral,0.5785,And for turn 5 we could suggest trying the back left instead of the back right. Back left is stabilizing. Does go to the deep maps. Yeah but is it minus 6 or minus 5? That's minus 5. Yeah so Apex is going to be the same.
Sergio Perez,neutral,0.9176,I've built a bit of a gap so you can chase gear sync to turn 10.
Sergio Perez,neutral,0.8659,"Okay so box, it's biscuit and switch off."
Fernando Alonso,admiration,0.9171,"You're good, by temperate tends to be very good."
Fernando Alonso,neutral,0.7017,"HPP run off, HPP run off, four more laps, four more laps. Can you try a lap where you don't use the exit of 10-12 curb? Stay off the exit curb of 10-12. Copy, why? We just want to check for the bouncing for now. We just want to check for the bouncing effect into 10-13."
Charles Leclerc,curiosity,0.5617,"What's the best gap? I would stay where you are, there's no good gap. Carlos should maybe come in this lap, so that should free up. No it's next lap, so there's staying out."
Charles Leclerc,neutral,0.6914,"So we can stay mode race because we have no burnouts, no bike point. Okay. Right side. Right side, confirm, right hand side and target two reds and K2 on until turn one."
Lance Stroll,admiration,0.928,At least the El AOG and his cuts are awesome.
Yuki Tsunoda,approval,0.4312,"Ok you can, this is in love, you can keep up the pace please, nobody pushing behind. Ah there was no good luck but yeah I felt also massive understood 3 somehow. Yeah we can see it."
Yuki Tsunoda,disappointment,0.4695,I want to increase the problem from cloud a little bit like one step but the guess of an insta bleach everything I don't think I have confidence to go forward and also traction Understood
Yuki Tsunoda,neutral,0.9652,Here we are processing the previous
Alexander Albon,neutral,0.7765,"Okay, go switch to go in the one with Russell Pixx6, read a quick in-lap please."
Alexander Albon,neutral,0.8237,"go switch to go call target double call so double call plus 10 target please so Logan just leave it there ahead of you now. massive, massive, understeer. Copy that, do you want to flap a chest? it's it's it's all the low speed not the high speed"
Alexander Albon,neutral,0.9616,"That's been 13 time laps, 13 time laps and target lap time 21-0."
Alexander Albon,neutral,0.4883,There's a lot of torque holes in the fourth gear. We've got to be worth having a look.
Alexander Albon,curiosity,0.4955,"So Alex, compared your competitors sector 3 is our weakest sector. Do you think you can do? I don't think you can push like if sector 1-2 will that help you with 3? I feel like I'm already doing it. But I can try more."
Guanyu Zhou,curiosity,0.7305,Can you tell me who was the driver racing booth?
Esteban Ocon,disappointment,0.263,"How was the balance, please? Yeah, it wasn't great. The bouncing was similar. The grouping downed one was a bit worse, slightly. Some understand to one. And the last corner, all through 13, the bouncing wasn't great. Okay, understood."
Esteban Ocon,approval,0.5358,"It doesn't recharge at the moment. Yeah, understood."
Esteban Ocon,approval,0.619,"and keep our pace up on the way into the recharge the battery and it will be AROP 3 after turn 9. Yeah, complete the battery was fine, I just needed to recharge on earlier. Yep, absolutely, no discreet."
Esteban Ocon,neutral,0.9638,"Here on the soft tire, 1 minute 20.7 correction on the medium."
Lewis Hamilton,neutral,0.9289,"George, 1988. Yeah, he's left eye as I'm pinnigin'."
Lewis Hamilton,neutral,0.9269,"Two laps remaining, just think about traction exit 5, exit 7, 8."
Lewis Hamilton,confusion,0.3571,"I said talk about the balance. Is that right? Yeah, I feel like. It's not you read that for quite a while, though."
Carlos Sainz,neutral,0.5757,"You have land on an outlapped behind, on used soft, perhaps on my fuel bar, I don't know, just don't make it by."
Carlos Sainz,neutral,0.9642,Open your infront and ring system test.
George Russell,disappointment,0.5372,"I lost a lot of time with the traffic in 10. Yeah, if I'm a saw that."
George Russell,disappointment,0.6616,"The acceleration from the brakes feels very poor. Even when I was doing the blindouts. Yeah, still poor."
George Russell,remorse,0.6907,"Big lock up that front left. Yeah, I've got my somewhere. I'm gonna just go apologize now and make everybody to stop."
Valtteri Bottas,approval,0.6056,"I could have blocked there in the end. Yeah, I saw that."
Oscar Piastri,neutral,0.913,"We've got a data issue, so we're boxing the slack back in the garage."
Max Verstappen,optimism,0.7097,"Okay, double slow, please Max. Let's hope you'd like to assess another step on the more aggressive tools. Yeah, let's ride. Understood. So, B-Bal 6 and the same toggle schedule. B-Bal 6. Double slow. It's okay, front-blow adjustment. No, that's good. Okay, understood. All cars are my gone outlets."
Max Verstappen,neutral,0.8645,I think Lando may have some damage after some contact with Leclerc.
Max Verstappen,neutral,0.375,"It could probably be the most relevant launch of the weekend max, so make use of it."
Logan Sargeant,neutral,0.4588,"Okay, we do drive through the pit lane, do you need to clap for just? Make a little... Okay, copy that."
Daniel Ricciardo,remorse,0.3494,"Daniel, turn 1-2-3. Anything we need to look at there? We didn't find them. Yeah, I was going to say that was weird. I felt no difference even with the other switches. I didn't care anything. What do you mean sorry? Anything in terms of grip? Nope. I didn't feel any difference compared to the previous tile. It only came later. We think we had more red wind before turn 1, but what about... ...Carspeed in jealous?"
Lando Norris,approval,0.7425,"Lannor, even if the next lap is poor, be really good to come around the final corner. Yeah, understood."
Lando Norris,approval,0.51,"Hey, you just, you just drove in to me? I think I've got damage. Okay, understood."
Lando Norris,neutral,0.6991,"As you approach the back, if we can have launch map on, then it will be 1 plus 1 burnouts, conservative left hand side. That's 1 plus 1, conservative left hand side. Conservative or standard? Conservative, please."
Pierre Gasly,neutral,0.7919,"And we'll go re-charge on, recharge on a box this lap. Okay, we can revert on that, no problem. We'd like to come into the pit lane and we'll do a start from the box. So no need for an arrow cruise, this one, so box this lap."
Pierre Gasly,disappointment,0.3506,We've got to do something for these breaks because they are really bad.
Sergio Perez,neutral,0.383,"Very poor drivability. Getting back on throttle a lot of forward. Okay, if Mars I turn 4, try to make it look good. Just the bare over and precious late entry speed. He wasn't throttle. He wasn't throttle picking up the throttle."
Sergio Perez,disappointment,0.6466,"Feedback when you're ready. Very poor drivability. Getting back on track a lot of four. Very poor. Okay, if Mars I turn four, Dr. Masey looks good. Just a bit over ambitious late entry speed."
Sergio Perez,annoyance,0.4193,"I will box it into this lap. Yeah, getting back on throttle and high speed support. What's quite a bit worse is lap around."
Sergio Perez,confusion,0.3456,"Back out the flat or we call it Woody's death test. Yeah, what about the alternative from the wing? Negative and not available at this stage."
Sergio Perez,neutral,0.5774,"Okay, no immediate threat so balance feedback when you can yeah One thing I run out of battery Inter from the balance I was just The rotation on the front end was getting better We're doing it with the disability. I think I was missing a bit of entry Yes"
Fernando Alonso,neutral,0.5283,"Yeah, the traction out of two is how much of fast behind now one is there that's okay and then album is two behind Then you got a bit of a gap. Okay, so everyone behind now is slow Yeah, for now there is tailwind as you come through. Yeah, yeah, but everybody Yeah, so you do think that double call is the right thing as well. It's a nice to slow now"
Fernando Alonso,neutral,0.9461,"Just have a look. There's a slippery track exit of 12 possibly a little bit of gravel on the exit curva 12 So have a look now as you come through A few cars have already been through that Sergeant is going to slow. Sergeant we'll be going into slow, yeah"
Charles Leclerc,admiration,0.7903,"Good job, undercar. It's... it's the forward. Happy to hear that."
Charles Leclerc,approval,0.5045,Yes we've seen it.
Charles Leclerc,confusion,0.8819,I don't understand what they do then. I think he blocked already as well.
Lance Stroll,admiration,0.5932,"So procedure is good, it will be a life stop on to a medium, we'll do the same again."
Lance Stroll,curiosity,0.2577,"Can you get me a knee pad prepared for the next run? No, some knee pain. Yeah, copy that and I'm small prepared, that is understood."
Lance Stroll,neutral,0.4043,"The tire is gone after one push. Yeah, it looks very extreme. A lot of laundry proofing actually."
Lance Stroll,approval,0.6153,"Okay, I think there's a load on the tracking."
Kevin Magnussen,approval,0.7766,"Okay, Ken, seeing that the rear is going a bit, suggests reducing increasing management to turn 9 little bits to try and help it. Yeah, I'm also just getting traffic all the time. Sure, understood."
Kevin Magnussen,confusion,0.4543,"is Piazza on his first slow or second? He's a bit strange, he's done an out lap and he's going slowly on his first first lap so I'm guessing he's going to go for it on the next lap."
Kevin Magnussen,neutral,0.8877,"So comparing the two Nico Carrot, it's a little bit later, gained a tenth under braking for turn one, and he carried a bit more apex speed through turn ten. That's any places you lost out to."
Yuki Tsunoda,approval,0.6931,The baller is not in the ball place. Understood.
Yuki Tsunoda,curiosity,0.5117,"How did you target? You were a business man's one. The lawyer had my soul much, uh, will spin. Understood."
Yuki Tsunoda,neutral,0.5071,"And target is blue 3 before 10, nobody behind. Do you mind me or sit back? Yeah."
Yuki Tsunoda,disappointment,0.4783,"And I think also last corner I think Baturus corner and I lost 12 lots. Yep, one behind. Yeah, battery will, it was not good so we'll let it fix for the next. Where I'm losing. Box box through the pit lane, through the pit lane to cool the tire, through the pit lane and we go out again."
Yuki Tsunoda,curiosity,0.4578,"What's the point? Why would we do one more push? You will stay out to do the start again. So we can do one more. If you don't want to, we can put the pit lane with the stars now. I can try."
Alexander Albon,confusion,0.5155,"What do you think about Flap? It's good. I don't really know where to go with violence. Engine through, two and three is good as well. I don't need a change there. Copy that."
Alexander Albon,caring,0.8306,"You're going to be careful with the brakes, because all of the bs in there are a bit. Yeah, we should have guys there with fans. Tams are okay from our side."
Guanyu Zhou,disapproval,0.6588,"I would not do another one, because it's getting worse, worse grip. Coming more, I would not just do the race three, a trailer."
Nico Hulkenberg,approval,0.5326,"We need double cools, don't really come down much yet. Okay, no problem. It's much less gusty windy than yesterday, right? Yes, same direction but much less magnitude."
Nico Hulkenberg,disapproval,0.6849,"Well no, it's not happening. Like the one feels very real if it did too much arrow balance. But afterwards, not so bad. There's definitely wind from outside in three, which isn't helping through there. And obviously, two is oversteer, which hurts the rear. Maybe it's just the grip of this tire."
Esteban Ocon,neutral,0.6492,"We're all up. Actually, Pink last corner was pretty big actually."
Esteban Ocon,gratitude,0.9888,"Okay, estimate. Great, thanks all of you for that. We are driving through to the end of the pit lane. We'd like one burnout and a start, please. So driving straight through, one burnout and a start."
Esteban Ocon,gratitude,0.9625,"Yeah, copy the stability and train one in seven is not the best also. The understanding corner was better with the flap. Okay, I understood. That was good, but today's one we're in this side where we're going in. Well, I managed that session. A few procedures and things to do as well. So quite busy one. Thank you for that. So we're going to the grid and we'll do a start on the left hand side. And we'll be pushing to pit entry once again. I'll let you know about burnouts one with a."
Lewis Hamilton,gratitude,0.9896,"Ok, thank you."
Lewis Hamilton,neutral,0.7822,"like this, so we go for the double call, you're at the car on track so you're all clear."
Lewis Hamilton,neutral,0.8509,"So there's a competitor yesterday, our only loss looks turned 4, 2-3-10s there, but we're going to turn 5. Everything else is probably within the noise, turn to track either."
Lewis Hamilton,neutral,0.8001,Turn four he said two or three tenths. Yeah we're just looking at the offload over the telemetry envelope we're just going off GPS but we're getting update in number. If you want to drive through right? You don't need to drive through but we're here if you need us.
Lewis Hamilton,approval,0.3601,"Yeah, so looking at the... go ahead. How does it say what target? Turn, should I do? It's you were a previous lap, so they were good. No, but the second one I mean. Yeah, so 75 front and before rear is a target. And looking at the telemetry data, looks like it's more the loss at turn 5 entry, so peak braking and a mid speed."
Lewis Hamilton,remorse,0.8132,"Maybe some gravel down exit turn to, sorry turn 12, a few cars have gone over it already."
Lewis Hamilton,disappointment,0.6114,"Biggest loss, turn 10 is with a couple of tents, turn 12 and another 10th. Strong start to the lap."
Lewis Hamilton,neutral,0.9699,heard Him bring La Nicole sent
Carlos Sainz,neutral,0.7281,"Break shape 0, we suggest an open diff 457 and 10. I don't know, also come along with the rotations, the diff. Okay, I can use the motor truck in exit turn 10."
George Russell,approval,0.452,"Could we just get a bit of poem for a bit of knee pad and please? Yeah, I think so."
George Russell,neutral,0.9652,"leukección. The... dedicated leg pattern, slew frontline..."
Oscar Piastri,curiosity,0.4079,"I think we need to go up a little bit to 9 and last corner felt pretty understeer. Copy, so let's come through the pits, we'll box this lap. How much would you like to add? Watch for Magnuson, sorry, let's call. Probably one, one half. Copy."
Oscar Piastri,neutral,0.9629,The other car bought it 10-7. They got caught out by gust of Taiwan into 10-7.
Oscar Piastri,neutral,0.7941,"Okay, track your shine, slippery turn 12, that's it, that could be gravel."
Max Verstappen,neutral,0.9412,Just a little like the wind picks up a little bit that much.
Max Verstappen,neutral,0.7021,"We can talk about it. Yeah, the cars. So many cars."
Max Verstappen,neutral,0.955,
Logan Sargeant,approval,0.5023,"Okay, Logan at the moment only one other car is on track, the truck is clean, so focus on warm up now."
Logan Sargeant,neutral,0.5023,"Okay, main loss is a main 5, front lap adjust. Copy."
Logan Sargeant,admiration,0.5765,"Okay Logan, feedback on tires please. Quite good, I felt like I was losing the rear last sector though. Opened well. Copy."
Logan Sargeant,admiration,0.6161,"It's been a painful weekend guys. I'm trying my best. Yeah, good job. Keep pushing tomorrow. Exactly, never give up."
Daniel Ricciardo,neutral,0.9559,synchronize all the gears and you know the target's brakes and tires
Daniel Ricciardo,neutral,0.8453,So Daniel only losses to Yuki are entry turn 4. We lose around half a tenth. Yuki is carrying bit more speed in entry and breaking minimum speed turn 14 where we also lose half a tenth. You are lifting a little bit more. I see turn 10 and turn 12 stability is still on the lower side. I would suggest to go one big forward on the offset before turn 10.
Pierre Gasly,curiosity,0.6435,"How's the balance so far? Balance is good, it's improved compared to P3. Okay. And tire readiness, any comments? That was good, but I lost sector as well. Okay, copy."
Pierre Gasly,desire,0.3301,"Yeah, that was a good last. Three seconds to Norris. So let's watch out for Norris 1.5. Yeah, let's just check the floor left side when I come back last corner. I want to be done. Okay, we'll have a look."
Pierre Gasly,admiration,0.5798,"So there will get B8 tomorrow with Sparrow as well. Uh, Parrow is actually PA already. Oh, but yeah, but that's without the penalty, right? Yep. Yeah, so it's 7 and B8 for the team, so that's good. Yep, good session mate. So let's focus on fuel saving."
Sergio Perez,neutral,0.9636,Make sure you got that gap between PTAX and the C2.
Fernando Alonso,curiosity,0.4133,"So first car pushing is Hamilton 17 seconds back and then Bottas is seven behind him. With Joe. Ok, you tell me. I will, yeah. Which car will you win? And then behind Bottas is Joe and he four behind him. So I think behind Joe is going to be our gap."
